00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:54.170
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.179
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.679
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.619
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour" special coverage
of the first debate between the two major-party

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.210
presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.480
The stage is set at Hofstra University on
Long Island, New York.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.440
With the election 43 days away the race tightening,
a lot is on the line tonight, Judy.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.610
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly is, Gwen, and
given that this is the first time these two

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.500
have faced each other one on one.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.300
Lester Holt of NBC News will be moderating.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.130
Joining us at the table are our regular contributors,
syndicated columnist Mark Shields, New York

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.720
Times columnist David Brooks, and from The
Cook Political Report, Amy Walter.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.500
We welcome all you have here for the next
two hours.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.970
Amy, let's start with you.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.970
What are you looking for?

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.890
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: Each
of these candidates has an enthusiasm gap

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.990
problem within their own party.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.000
So, they have got to get their partisans fired
up.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.800
For Hillary Clinton, it's young people.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.870
For Donald Trump, he's got to get those white
college-educated voters back into the Republican

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.960
fold, where they have been.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.690
And then they have got to get those voters,
both of them, who are torn, don't like either

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.050
choice they have in front of them, to pick
them.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.080
GWEN IFILL: Mark Shields, what would you -- surprise
you the most of what these candidates might

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080
or might not do tonight?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.229
MARK SHIELDS: Does Donald Trump dare to be
boring?

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.990
Does he come out sedated/presidential?

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.180
And can Hillary Clinton, who is a marvelous
and superior deliverer of information, make

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690
an emotional connection with American voters?

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.799
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, what are you on the
edge of your seat looking for?

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.530
DAVID BROOKS: We have been around each other
too long.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.680
I wrote down emotional connection.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680
MARK SHIELDS: Did you?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.680
DAVID BROOKS: This is not a cognitive night.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680
This is not philosophy.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.150
This is not grand strategy.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.069
It's moment of intimacy, that unscripted moment
when the unconscious is revealed that will

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.370
be replayed on YouTube over and over and over
again.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.719
And so it's just, is he commanding or is he
cruel?

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.889
Is she relatable and does she seem calmly
smart?

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.630
And it's whether people get that vibe, the
first they vibe, that will determine the night.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.889
GWEN IFILL: Is this about what they know or
who they are?

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.349
AMY WALTER: Well, I think it's mostly about
who they are.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.129
For voters at this stage of the game, they
are looking up on that dais to see who they

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.810
can spend the next four years with, who they
want to invite into their homes moment after

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.810
moment.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.639
Many voters say, I don't want either one of
them in there.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.639
GWEN IFILL: A lot of them.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.900
AMY WALTER: A lot of voters are saying that.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.799
But this is the one maybe that they're not
going to like, but they will feel comfortable

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.799
enough.

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.540
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, people are going
to be fact-checking this debate.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.469
They're going to be raising questions about
whether what either one of them said was correct

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.469
or not.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:21.510
MARK SHIELDS: No, you're right, Judy.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.730
And if it's what they know, it will be a short
evening...

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.730
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.129
MARK SHIELDS: ... for the Republican nominee,
whose knowledge bank has been overdrawn.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.279
And I think it's about, more than anything
else, each case, what does he know, his command

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.099
of it, is he comfortable with it, and who
she is.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.569
And I think that is really the question.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.480
DAVID BROOKS: And there is the gender politics.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.480
GWEN IFILL: OK.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.200
Well, we're turning now to Lester Holt of
NBC News.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200
TRANSCRIPT START

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University
in Hempstead, New York.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
I'm Lester Holt, anchor of "NBC Nightly News."

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200
I want to welcome you to the first presidential
debate.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200
The participants tonight are Donald Trump
and Hillary Clinton.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200
This debate is sponsored by the Commission
on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200
organization.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.349
The commission drafted tonight's format, and
the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.889
The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments,
each 15 minutes long.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.389
We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving
prosperity; America's direction; and securing

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.959
America.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.139
At the start of each segment, I will ask the
same lead-off question to both candidates,

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.310
and they will each have up to two minutes
to respond.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.370
From that point until the end of the segment,
we'll have an open discussion.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.970
The questions are mine and have not been shared
with the commission or the campaigns.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.160
The audience here in the room has agreed to
remain silent so that we can focus on what

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.870
the candidates are saying.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.190
I will invite you to applaud, however, at
this moment, as we welcome the candidates:

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.140
Democratic nominee for president of the United
States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:51.320
for president of the United States, Donald
J. Trump.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.940
(APPLAUSE)

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:01.050
CLINTON: How are you, Donald?

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.670
(APPLAUSE)

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:10.770
HOLT: Good luck to you.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.390
(APPLAUSE)

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.560
Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues
of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.580
there are two more presidential debates scheduled.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.880
We are going to focus on many of the issues
that voters tell us are most important, and

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.400
we're going to press for specifics.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.160
I am honored to have this role, but this evening
belongs to the candidates and, just as important,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.620
to the American people.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.920
Candidates, we look forward to hearing you
articulate your policies and your positions,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.850
as well as your visions and your values.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.980
So, let's begin.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.440
We're calling this opening segment "Achieving
Prosperity."

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.190
And central to that is jobs.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.060
There are two economic realities in America
today.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.950
There's been a record six straight years of
job growth, and new census numbers show incomes

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.810
have increased at a record rate after years
of stagnation.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.320
However, income inequality remains significant,
and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.860
to paycheck.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.070
Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why
are you a better choice than your opponent

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.780
to create the kinds of jobs that will put
more money into the pockets of American works?

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.120
CLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks
to Hofstra for hosting us.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.930
The central question in this election is really
what kind of country we want to be and what

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.680
kind of future we'll build together.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.060
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday,
so I think about this a lot.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.370
First, we have to build an economy that works
for everyone, not just those at the top.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.580
That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with
rising incomes.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.530
I want us to invest in you.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.930
I want us to invest in your future.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.630
That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced
manufacturing, innovation and technology,

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.530
clean, renewable energy, and small business,
because most of the new jobs will come from

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.190
small business.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.110
We also have to make the economy fairer.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.840
That starts with raising the national minimum
wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.060
for women's work.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.050
CLINTON: I also want to see more companies
do profit-sharing.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.370
If you help create the profits, you should
be able to share in them, not just the executives

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.050
at the top.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.900
And I want us to do more to support people
who are struggling to balance family and work.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.720
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult
choices you face and the stresses that you're

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720
under.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.050
So let's have paid family leave, earned sick
days.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.620
Let's be sure we have affordable child care
and debt-free college.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.620
How are we going to do it?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.760
We're going to do it by having the wealthy
pay their fair share and close the corporate

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.930
loopholes.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:56.980
Finally, we tonight are on the stage together,
Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.670
with you.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.850
We're going to have a debate where we are
talking about the important issues facing

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.150
our country.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:11.560
You have to judge us, who can shoulder the
immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.860
who can put into action the plans that will
make your life better.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.140
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote
on November 8th.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.940
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.440
Mr. Trump, the same question to you.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.700
It's about putting money -- more money into
the pockets of American workers.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.700
You have up to two minutes.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.150
TRUMP: 21:08:32 Thank you, Lester.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.459
Our jobs are fleeing the country.

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:33.570
They're going to Mexico.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.890
They're going to many other countries.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.029
You look at what China is doing to our country
in terms of making our product.

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:44.930
They're devaluing their currency, and there's
nobody in our government to fight them.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.260
And we have a very good fight.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.070
And we have a winning fight.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.710
Because they're using our country as a piggy
bank to rebuild China, and many other countries

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.480
are doing the same thing.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.760
So we're losing our good jobs, so many of
them.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.580
When you look at what's happening in Mexico,
a friend of mine who builds plants said it's

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.010
the eighth wonder of the world.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.200
They're building some of the biggest plants
anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.860
some of the best plants.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.610
With the United States, as he said, not so
much.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.320
So Ford is leaving.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.990
You see that, their small car division leaving.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.860
Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving
Ohio.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.610
They're all leaving.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.710
And we can't allow it to happen anymore.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.750
As far as child care is concerned and so many
other things, I think Hillary and I agree

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.760
on that.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.160
We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers
and amounts and what we're going to do, but

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.730
perhaps we'll be talking about that later.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.110
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen
from us.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:50.360
We have to stop our companies from leaving
the United States and, with it, firing all

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360
of their people.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.370
All you have to do is take a look at Carrier
air conditioning in Indianapolis.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.220
They left -- fired 1,400 people.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.950
They're going to Mexico.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.030
So many hundreds and hundreds of companies
are doing this.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.690
TRUMP: We cannot let it happen.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:13.640
Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously,
from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.339
small and big businesses.

00:10:15.339 --> 00:10:19.740
That's going to be a job creator like we haven't
seen since Ronald Reagan.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.360
It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.490
Companies will come.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.490
They will build.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.490
They will expand.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.290
New companies will start.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.450
And I look very, very much forward to doing
it.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.830
We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and
we have to stop these countries from stealing

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.610
our companies and our jobs.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.880
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to
respond?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.540
CLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important
issue.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.720
Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's
population; we have to trade with the other

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.350
95 percent.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.690
And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:57.620
We also, though, need to have a tax system
that rewards work and not just financial transactions.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.880
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth
would be trickle-down economics all over again.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:09.500
In fact, it would be the most extreme version,
the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.870
the people in this country than we've ever
had.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:17.210
I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because
that's exactly what it would be.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.030
That is not how we grow the economy.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.740
We just have a different view about what's
best for growing the economy, how we make

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.830
investments that will actually produce jobs
and rising incomes.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.700
I think we come at it from somewhat different
perspectives.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.170
I understand that.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:39.680
You know, Donald was very fortunate in his
life, and that's all to his benefit.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.339
He started his business with $14 million,
borrowed from his father, and he really believes

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:50.240
that the more you help wealthy people, the
better off we'll be and that everything will

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240
work out from there.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.930
I don't buy that.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.430
I have a different experience.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.740
My father was a small-businessman.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.360
He worked really hard.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.850
He printed drapery fabrics on long tables,
where he pulled out those fabrics and he went

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.580
down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint
in and took the squeegee and kept going.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.790
And so what I believe is the more we can do
for the middle class, the more we can invest

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:18.460
in you, your education, your skills, your
future, the better we will be off and the

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.600
better we'll grow.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.710
That's the kind of economy I want us to see
again.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.710
21:12:21

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.710
HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if
you can.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.050
You've talked about creating 25 million jobs,
and you've promised to bring back millions

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.790
of jobs for Americans.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:34.330
How are you going to bring back the industries
that have left this country for cheaper labor

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.330
overseas?

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.920
How, specifically, are you going to tell American
manufacturers that you have to come back?

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:44.050
TRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we
start on that -- my father gave me a very

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.430
small loan in 1975, and I built it into a
company that's worth many, many billions of

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.279
dollars, with some of the greatest assets
in the world, and I say that only because

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.520
that's the kind of thinking that our country
needs.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.250
Our country's in deep trouble.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.580
We don't know what we're doing when it comes
to devaluations and all of these countries

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.960
all over the world, especially China.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.540
They're the best, the best ever at it.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.900
What they're doing to us is a very, very sad
thing.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.220
So we have to do that.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.260
We have to renegotiate our trade deals.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.370
And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're
giving incentives, they're doing things that,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.370
frankly, we don't do.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.980
Let me give you the example of Mexico.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980
They have a VAT tax.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.520
We're on a different system.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.279
When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:29.720
When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent,
approximately.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.540
When they sell into us, there's no tax.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.690
It's a defective agreement.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.560
It's been defective for a long time, many
years, but the politicians haven't done anything

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.560
about it.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.010
Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton
-- yes, is that OK?

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.010
Good.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.770
I want you to be very happy.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.610
It's very important to me.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.399
But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,
when she started talking about this, it was

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.589
really very recently.

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:56.839
She's been doing this for 30 years.

00:13:56.839 --> 00:13:59.010
And why hasn't she made the agreements better?

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.080
The NAFTA agreement is defective.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.250
Just because of the tax and many other reasons,
but just because of the fact...

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.690
HOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:10.850
TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians,
should have been doing this for years, not

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.950
right now, because of the fact that we've
created a movement.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.580
They should have been doing this for years.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:24.029
What's happened to our jobs and our country
and our economy generally is -- look, we owe

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.660
$20 trillion.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.520
We cannot do it any longer, Lester.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.740
HOLT: 21:14:28 Back to the question, though.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.120
How do you bring back -- specifically bring
back jobs, American manufacturers?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.610
How do you make them bring the jobs back?

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.040
TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't
let the jobs leave.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.399
The companies are leaving.

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.709
I could name, I mean, there are thousands
of them.

00:14:40.709 --> 00:14:43.900
They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger
numbers than ever.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.140
And what you do is you say, fine, you want
to go to Mexico or some other country, good

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.140
luck.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.140
We wish you a lot of luck.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.850
But if you think you're going to make your
air conditioners or your cars or your cookies

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:58.900
or whatever you make and bring them into our
country without a tax, you're wrong.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.470
And once you say you're going to have to tax
them coming in, and our politicians never

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.459
do this, because they have special interests
and the special interests want those companies

00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:10.580
to leave, because in many cases, they own
the companies.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.580
So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from
leaving.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.029
We have to stop them from leaving.

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:18.170
And that's a big, big factor.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.990
HOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in
here.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:25.290
CLINTON: 21:15:19 Well, let's stop for a second
and remember where we were eight years ago.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.850
We had the worst financial crisis, the Great
Recession, the worst since the 1930s.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:37.800
That was in large part because of tax policies
that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:45.180
to invest in the middle class, took their
eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.180
storm.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.380
In fact, Donald was one of the people who
rooted for the housing crisis.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.980
He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does
collapse, because then I can go in and buy

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.420
some and make some money."

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.420
Well, it did collapse.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.020
TRUMP: 21:16:02 That's called business, by
the way.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.480
CLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million
people lost their jobs.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.230
Five million people lost their homes.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.450
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped
out.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.250
Now, we have come back from that abyss.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.000
And it has not been easy.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.350
So we're now on the precipice of having a
potentially much better economy, but the last

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:29.270
thing we need to do is to go back to the policies
that failed us in the first place.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.980
Independent experts have looked at what I've
proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed,

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:40.270
and basically they've said this, that if his
tax plan, which would blow up the debt by

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:47.279
over $5 trillion and would in some instances
disadvantage middle-class families compared

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:53.950
to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we
would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.110
another recession.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.450
They've looked at my plans and they've said,
OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:07.189
it done, we will have 10 million more new
jobs, because we will be making investments

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:09.260
where we can grow the economy.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.679
Take clean energy.

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:15.760
Some country is going to be the clean- energy
superpower of the 21st century.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.970
Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax
perpetrated by the Chinese.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:20.970
I think it's real.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:21.970
TRUMP: I did not.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:22.970
I did not.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:23.970
I do not say that.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:24.970
CLINTON: I think science is real.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:25.970
TRUMP: I do not say that.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.030
CLINTON: And I think it's important that we
grip this and deal with it, both at home and

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.030
abroad.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.030
And here's what we can do.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.400
We can deploy a half a billion more solar
panels.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.620
We can have enough clean energy to power every
home.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.540
We can build a new modern electric grid.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.040
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new
economic activity.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:49.410
So I've tried to be very specific about what
we can and should do, and I am determined

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.240
that we're going to get the economy really
moving again, building on the progress we've

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.330
made over the last eight years, but never
going back to what got us in trouble in the

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.330
first place.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.330
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.600
TRUMP: She talks about solar panels.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.990
We invested in a solar company, our country.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.990
That was a disaster.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.940
They lost plenty of money on that one.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:13.210
Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms
of energy, but we're putting a lot of people

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.210
out of work.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.150
Our energy policies are a disaster.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:21.330
Our country is losing so much in terms of
energy, in terms of paying off our debt.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:25.200
You can't do what you're looking to do with
$20 trillion in debt.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:32.750
The Obama administration, from the time they've
come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.130
and he's topped it.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:39.220
He's doubled it in a course of almost eight
years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi-

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.220
exact.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.760
So I will tell you this.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.799
We have to do a much better job at keeping
our jobs.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:51.890
And we have to do a much better job at giving
companies incentives to build new companies

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.049
or to expand, because they're not doing it.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:58.520
21:18:59 And all you have to do is look at
Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:05.690
of these places where so many of their jobs
and their companies are just leaving, they're

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.690
gone.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.250
And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:12.059
You've been doing this for 30 years.

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:14.460
Why are you just thinking about these solutions
right now?

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.179
For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now
you're just starting to think of solutions.

00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:19.179
CLINTON: Well, actually...

00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:20.500
TRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.370
I will bring back jobs.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.630
You can't bring back jobs.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.550
CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about
this quite a bit.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.550
TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.420
CLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that
long.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.380
I think my husband did a pretty good job in
the 1990s.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.870
I think a lot about what worked and how we
can make it work again...

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.280
TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.280
(CROSSTALK)

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280
CLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced
budget...

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.633
TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single
worst trade deal ever approved in this country.

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:45.750
CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.320
Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s,
if we're actually going to look at the facts.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.300
When I was in the Senate, I had a number of
trade deals that came before me, and I held

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.710
them all to the same test.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.550
Will they create jobs in America?

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.210
Will they raise incomes in America?

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.419
And are they good for our national security?

00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:05.580
Some of them I voted for.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.280
The biggest one, a multinational one known
as CAFTA, I voted against.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.560
And because I hold the same standards as I
look at all of these trade deals.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:22.530
But let's not assume that trade is the only
challenge we have in the economy.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.450
I think it is a part of it, and I've said
what I'm going to do.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.480
I'm going to have a special prosecutor.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.549
We're going to enforce the trade deals we
have, and we're going to hold people accountable.

00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:38.370
When I was secretary of state, we actually
increased American exports globally 30 percent.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.350
We increased them to China 50 percent.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:48.280
So I know how to really work to get new jobs
and to get exports that helped to create more

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.280
new jobs.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.280
HOLT: Very quickly...

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.590
TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years
or 26 years or any number you want to...

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.610
CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.711
TRUMP: You haven't done it.

00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:55.711
You haven't done it.

00:20:55.711 --> 00:20:56.711
CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...

00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:57.711
TRUMP: Excuse me.

00:20:57.711 --> 00:20:58.711
CLINTON: And I have done a lot...

00:20:58.711 --> 00:21:01.360
TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was
one of the worst things that ever happened

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360
to the manufacturing industry.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.360
CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.360
That is your opinion.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:09.179
TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio,
Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary

00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:15.080
Clinton, and you will see devastation where
manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.670
NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed
anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.670
country.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.490
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific
Partnership.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.320
You were totally in favor of it.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.140
Then you heard what I was saying, how bad
it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.530
But you know that if you did win, you would
approve that, and that will be almost as bad

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:34.530
as NAFTA.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.809
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.

00:21:35.809 --> 00:21:38.400
CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:45.140
I was against it once it was finally negotiated
and the terms were laid out.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.140
I wrote about that in...

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.620
TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.620
(CROSSTALK)

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.900
TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of
trade deals.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.240
You said it's the finest deal you've ever
seen.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240
CLINTON: No.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.670
TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about
it, and all of a sudden you were against it.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:01.770
CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in
your own reality, but that is not the facts.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:06.100
The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would
be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
TRUMP: Not.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.419
CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for,
I concluded it wasn't.

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:11.419
I wrote about that in my book...

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:12.880
TRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880
CLINTON: ... before you even announced.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.880
TRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.419
CLINTON: Look, there are differences...

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:18.830
TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's
fault?

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:19.830
CLINTON: There are...

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.830
TRUMP: Because he's pushing it.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:25.880
CLINTON: There are different views about what's
good for our country, our economy, and our

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.540
leadership in the world.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:32.110
And I think it's important to look at what
we need to do to get the economy going again.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:38.020
That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes,
investments, not in more tax cuts that would

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.060
add $5 trillion to the debt.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.060
TRUMP: But you have no plan.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.660
CLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.190
TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.210
CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about
it.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.210
It's called "Stronger Together."

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.680
You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.690
TRUMP: That's about all you've...

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.690
(CROSSTALK)

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.690
HOLT: Folks, we're going to...

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.690
CLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.690
HOLT: We're going to move to...

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:58.310
CLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we
need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.310
growth.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:04.700
We also have to look at how we help families
balance the responsibilities at home and the

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.400
responsibilities at business.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.320
So we have a very robust set of plans.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.881
And people have looked at both of our plans,
have concluded that mine would create 10 million

00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:20.750
jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs,
and explode the debt which would have a recession.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.059
TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the
biggest tax cuts in history.

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:28.480
21:23:20 You are going to approve one of the
biggest tax increases in history.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.010
You are going to drive business out.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.290
Your regulations are a disaster, and you're
going to increase regulations all over the

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.290
place.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.460
And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest
since Ronald Reagan.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.150
I'm very proud of it.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.309
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.

00:23:43.309 --> 00:23:48.290
But regulations, you are going to regulate
these businesses out of existence.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.910
When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this,
I've been all over.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:56.980
And when I go around, despite the tax cut,
the thing -- the things that business as in

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.730
people like the most is the fact that I'm
cutting regulation.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:07.830
You have regulations on top of regulations,
and new companies cannot form and old companies

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.169
are going out of business.

00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:12.160
And you want to increase the regulations and
make them even worse.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.049
I'm going to cut regulations.

00:24:14.049 --> 00:24:20.030
I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're
going to raise taxes big league, end of story.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.260
HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there,
because we're going to move into -- we're

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.260
going to move into the next segment.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.260
We're going to talk taxes...

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.600
CLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left
to stand.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.030
HOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then
we're going to go on.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:32.130
CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would
be a lot of these charges and claims, and

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.130
so...

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.130
TRUMP: Facts.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.660
CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of
my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.120
turned it into a fact-checker.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.150
So if you want to see in real-time what the
facts are, please go and take a look.

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.150
Because what I have proposed...

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.150
TRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and
you'll see.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:53.539
CLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the
debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:54.539
to the debt.

00:24:54.539 --> 00:25:00.780
What I have proposed would cut regulations
and streamline them for small businesses.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:08.340
What I have proposed would be paid for by
raising taxes on the wealthy, because they

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.630
have made all the gains in the economy.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.590
And I think it's time that the wealthy and
corporations paid their fair share to support

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.590
this country.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.590
HOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.590
TRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think
I...

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.590
(CROSSTALK)

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.590
HOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right
here...

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.950
TRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website,
and you take a look at her website.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.320
HOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.360
TRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.679
HOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...

00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:28.740
TRUMP: And look at her website.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.740
You know what?

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.740
It's no difference than this.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.410
She's telling us how to fight ISIS.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.410
Just go to her website.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.590
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.780
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would
like that too much.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.700
HOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.020
CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight
ISIS.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.020
HOLT: ... achieving prosperity...

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.220
TRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything
you want to do.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220
CLINTON: No, we're not.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.220
No, we're not.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.770
TRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything
you want to do.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:54.850
No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder
you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:55.850
life.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.991
CLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please,
fact checkers, get to work.

00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:01.460
HOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.050
And we're still on the issue of achieving
prosperity.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.470
And I want to talk about taxes.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.300
The fundamental difference between the two
of you concerns the wealthy.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.330
Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax
increase on the wealthiest Americans.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.140
I'd like you to further defend that.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.960
And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts
for the wealthy.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.280
I'd like you to defend that.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.910
And this next two-minute answer goes to you,
Mr. Trump.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.929
TRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major
jobs, because the wealthy are going create

00:26:25.929 --> 00:26:27.120
tremendous jobs.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.950
They're going to expand their companies.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.590
They're going to do a tremendous job.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.130
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.370
And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's
really not a great thing for the wealthy.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.239
It's a great thing for the middle class.

00:26:39.239 --> 00:26:41.630
It's a great thing for companies to expand.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.230
And when these people are going to put billions
and billions of dollars into companies, and

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.789
when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion
back from overseas, where they can't bring

00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:55.840
the money back, because politicians like Secretary
Clinton won't allow them to bring the money

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.030
back, because the taxes are so onerous, and
the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.030
bad.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.940
So what they're doing is they're leaving our
country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.970
because taxes are too high and because some
of them have lots of money outside of our

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.970
country.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.350
And instead of bringing it back and putting
the money to work, because they can't work

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.950
out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should
be brought back.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:22.740
Instead of that, they're leaving our country
to get their money, because they can't bring

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.720
their money back into our country, because
of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720
get together.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.150
Because we have -- we have a president that
can't sit them around a table and get them

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.300
to approve something.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.940
And here's the thing.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.000
Republicans and Democrats agree that this
should be done, $2.5 trillion.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.600
I happen to think it's double that.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.510
It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring
into our country, Lester.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:51.409
And with a little leadership, you'd get it
in here very quickly, and it could be put

00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:55.590
to use on the inner cities and lots of other
things, and it would be beautiful.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.659
But we have no leadership.

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:00.090
And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.090
21:28:01

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:02.090
HOLT: All right.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.299
You have two minutes of the same question
to defend tax increases on the wealthiest

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:06.299
Americans, Secretary Clinton.

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:08.669
CLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end
of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:10.480
everything that's ever happened.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.890
TRUMP: Why not?

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.299
CLINTON: Why not?

00:28:13.299 --> 00:28:14.710
Yeah, why not?

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:15.710
(LAUGHTER)

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.820
You know, just join the debate by saying more
crazy things.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.680
Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the
case...

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.980
TRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting
our companies bring their money back into

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.980
their country.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.280
HOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's
two minutes, please.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.280
TRUMP: Yes.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.650
CLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock
again, Lester.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.630
We've looked at your tax proposals.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:41.920
I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates
or the kinds of proposals you're referring

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:47.470
to that would cause the repatriation, bringing
back of money that's stranded overseas.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.470
I happen to support that.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.470
TRUMP: Then you didn't read it.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.970
CLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support
that in a way that will actually work to our

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.419
benefit.

00:28:55.419 --> 00:29:01.430
But when I look at what you have proposed,
you have what is called now the 21:29:01 Trump

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.710
loophole, because it would so advantage you
and the business you do.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.090
You've proposed an approach that has a...

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.200
TRUMP: Who gave it that name?

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.200
The first I've -- who gave it that name?

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.200
(CROSSTALK)

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.200
HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's
two minutes.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.790
CLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your
family.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.559
And when you look at what you are proposing...

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.559
TRUMP: How much?

00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:18.559
How much for my family?

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:19.559
CLINTON: ... it is...

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:20.559
TRUMP: Lester, how much?

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:21.559
CLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:24.450
Trickle-down did not work.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.280
It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008
and 2009.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.080
Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.140
And a lot of really smart, wealthy people
know that.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.950
And they are saying, hey, we need to do more
to make the contributions we should be making

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.240
to rebuild the middle class.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.130
CLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:51.350
I think building the middle class, investing
in the middle class, making college debt-free

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:58.080
so more young people can get their education,
helping people refinance their -- their debt

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.799
from college at a lower rate.

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:03.380
Those are the kinds of things that will really
boost the economy.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:10.030
Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need
in America, not more advantages for people

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.559
at the very top.

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:13.630
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.030
TRUMP: Typical politician.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.720
All talk, no action.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.780
Sounds good, doesn't work.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.160
Never going to happen.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:28.350
Our country is suffering because people like
Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.980
in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's
going on.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:37.360
Now, look, we have the worst revival of an
economy since the Great Depression.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.860
And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.789
And the only thing that looks good is the
stock market, but if you raise interest rates

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:46.370
even a little bit, that's going to come crashing
down.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.049
We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.

00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:51.160
And we better be awfully careful.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.240
And we have a Fed that's doing political things.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.830
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.030
The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the
interest rates at this level.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.150
And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and
he leaves, and goes out to the golf course

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.529
for the rest of his life to play golf 21:31:00,
when they raise interest rates, you're going

00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:13.340
to see some very bad things happen, because
the Fed is not doing their job.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.789
The Fed is being more political than Secretary
Clinton.

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:22.080
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden
that Americans have to pay, yet you have not

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.740
released your tax returns.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.500
And the reason nominees have released their
returns for decades is so that voters will

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:35.900
know if their potential president owes money
to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.559
Don't Americans have a right to know if there
are any conflicts of interest?

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:41.380
TRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under
a routine audit.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.650
And it'll be released.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.120
And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it
will be released.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.631
But you will learn more about Donald Trump
by going down to the federal elections, where

00:31:50.631 --> 00:31:57.850
I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement
of sorts, the forms that they have.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.850
It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I
just looked today -- the income is filed at

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:08.080
$694 million for this past year, $694 million.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.279
If you would have told me I was going to make
that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.320
very surprised.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.910
But that's the kind of thinking that our country
needs.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:21.090
When we have a country that's doing so badly,
that's being ripped off by every single country

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:27.750
in the world, it's the kind of thinking that
our country needs, because everybody -- Lester,

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:34.740
we have a trade deficit with all of the countries
that we do business with, of almost $800 billion

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.090
a year.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.090
You know what that is?

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.679
That means, who's negotiating these trade
deals?

00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:43.789
We have people that are political hacks negotiating
our trade deals.

00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:44.789
HOLT: The IRS says an audit...

00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:45.789
TRUMP: Excuse me.

00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:50.409
HOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly
free to release your taxes during an audit.

00:32:50.409 --> 00:32:54.740
And so the question, does the public's right
to know outweigh your personal...

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.960
TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them
as soon as the audit.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.970
Look, I've been under audit almost for 15
years.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.340
21:33:00 I know a lot of wealthy people that
have never been audited.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.529
I said, do you get audited?

00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:06.679
I get audited almost every year.

00:33:06.679 --> 00:33:08.220
And in a way, I should be complaining.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.270
I'm not even complaining.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.270
I don't mind it.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.309
It's almost become a way of life.

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:13.160
I get audited by the IRS.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.480
But other people don't.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.100
I will say this.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.210
We have a situation in this country that has
to be taken care of.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:28.520
I will release my tax returns -- against my
lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.110
e-mails that have been deleted.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.890
As soon as she releases them, I will release.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:34.890
(APPLAUSE)

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.429
I will release my tax returns.

00:33:37.429 --> 00:33:40.240
And that's against -- my lawyers, they say,
"Don't do it."

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.299
I will tell you this.

00:33:41.299 --> 00:33:46.600
No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading
the papers.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.140
Almost every lawyer says, you don't release
your returns until the audit's complete.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.429
When the audit's complete, I'll do it.

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:55.120
But I would go against them if she releases
her e-mails.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.980
HOLT: So it's negotiable?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980
TRUMP: It's not negotiable, no.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.980
Let her release the e-mails.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980
Why did she delete 33,000...

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.391
HOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that.

00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:03.799
But let me just admonish the audience one
more time.

00:34:03.799 --> 00:34:04.799
There was an agreement.

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:07.160
We did ask you to be silent, so it would be
helpful for us.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160
Secretary Clinton?

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.040
CLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another
example of bait-and- switch here.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.200
For 40 years, everyone running for president
has released their tax returns.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.030
You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40
years of our tax returns, but everyone has

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.030
done it.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.599
We know the IRS has made clear there is no
prohibition on releasing it when you're under

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.599
audit.

00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:35.149
So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he
release his tax returns?

00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:37.869
And I think there may be a couple of reasons.

00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:41.450
First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he
is.

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:45.200
Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he
claims to be.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:52.119
CLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business
dealings, but we have been told through investigative

00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:59.200
reporting that he owes about $650 million
to Wall Street and foreign banks.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.119
Or maybe he doesn't want the American people,
all of you watching tonight, to know that

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:09.710
he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because
the only years that anybody's ever seen were

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:14.240
a couple of years when he had to turn them
over to state authorities when he was trying

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.839
to get a casino license, and they showed he
didn't pay any federal income tax.

00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:20.500
21:35:27 TRUMP: That makes me smart.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:27.060
CLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means
zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.700
or health.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:36.630
And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic
about having the rest of our country see what

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:41.640
the real reasons are, because it must be something
really important, even terrible, that he's

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.080
trying to hide.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.870
And the financial disclosure statements, they
don't give you the tax rate.

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:51.230
They don't give you all the details that tax
returns would.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:56.530
And it just seems to me that this is something
that the American people deserve to see.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:02.730
And I have no reason to believe that he's
ever going to release his tax returns, because

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.070
there's something he's hiding.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.410
And we'll guess.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:09.270
We'll keep guessing at what it might be that
he's hiding.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:15.200
But I think the question is, were he ever
to get near the White House, what would be

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.570
those conflicts?

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.870
Who does he owe money to?

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:23.170
Well, he owes you the answers to that, and
he should provide them.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:25.680
HOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue
of your e-mails.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.859
Do you want to respond to that?

00:36:26.859 --> 00:36:27.859
CLINTON: I do.

00:36:27.859 --> 00:36:31.490
You know, I made a mistake using a private
e- mail.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.589
TRUMP: That's for sure.

00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:37.580
CLINTON: And if I had to do it over again,
I would, obviously, do it differently.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.330
But I'm not going to make any excuses.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.841
It was a mistake, and I take responsibility
for that.

00:36:41.841 --> 00:36:42.841
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:46.910
TRUMP: That was more than a mistake.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.120
That was done purposely.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.120
OK?

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120
That was not a mistake.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120
That was done purposely.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:57.580
When you have your staff taking the Fifth
Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:03.280
prosecuted, when you have the man that set
up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.800
think it's disgraceful.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.880
And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really
thinks it's disgraceful, also.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.730
As far as my tax returns, you don't learn
that much from tax returns.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:14.780
That I can tell you.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.170
You learn a lot from financial disclosure.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.380
And you should go down and take a look at
that.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.690
The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:27.260
The report that said $650 -- which, by the
way, a lot of friends of mine that know my

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.550
business say, boy, that's really not a lot
of money.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.880
It's not a lot of money relative to what I
had.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.810
The buildings that were in question, they
said in the same report, which was -- actually,

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:41.510
it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with
you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.680
And the $650 isn't even on that.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.100
But it's not $650.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.520
It's much less than that.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.740
But I could give you a list of banks, I would
-- if that would help you, I would give you

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.740
a list of banks.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.370
These are very fine institutions, very fine
banks.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.650
I could do that very quickly.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.900
I am very underleveraged.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.150
I have a great company.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.970
I have a tremendous income.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:02.290
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios
way.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:08.680
It's because it's about time that this country
had somebody running it that has an idea about

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.020
money.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:14.760
When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our
country's a mess, you know, it's one thing

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.070
to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads
are good and our bridges are good and everything's

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.390
in great shape, our airports.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.880
21:38:25 Our airports are like from a third
world country.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.970
You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy,
you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:33.609
come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these
incredible -- you come in from China, you

00:38:33.609 --> 00:38:39.290
see these incredible airports, and you land
-- we've become a third world country.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.800
So the worst of all things has happened.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.980
We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.750
We haven't even started.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:53.090
And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle
East, according to a report that I just saw.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:58.310
Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's
6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.490
have rebuilt our country twice.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:01.520
And it's really a shame.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.460
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton
that have caused this problem.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.060
Our country has tremendous problems.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.400
We're a debtor nation.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.330
We're a serious debtor nation.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:17.400
And we have a country that needs new roads,
new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.680
schools, new hospitals.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.000
And we don't have the money, because it's
been squandered on so many of your ideas.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.920
HOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move
on to the next segment.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.920
CLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid
any federal income tax for a lot of years.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920
(APPLAUSE)

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.670
And the other thing I think is important...

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.339
TRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe
me.

00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:37.349
CLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim
to be president of the United States is your

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:40.950
business, then I think we should talk about
that.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:47.170
You know, your campaign manager said that
you built a lot of businesses on the backs

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.170
of little guys.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:54.440
And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people
who were stiffed by you and your businesses,

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.440
Donald.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:04.070
I've met dishwashers, painters, architects,
glass installers, marble installers, drapery

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:12.130
installers, like my dad was, who you refused
to pay when they finished the work that you

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.349
asked them to do.

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:18.240
We have an architect in the audience who designed
one of your clubhouses at one of your golf

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.130
courses.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.460
It's a beautiful facility.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.960
It immediately was put to use.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.572
And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to
be paid, what he was charging you to do...

00:40:30.572 --> 00:40:33.710
TRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I
was unsatisfied with his work...

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:34.710
CLINTON: Well, to...

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:35.710
TRUMP: Which our country should do, too.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:40.690
CLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you
have stiffed over the course of your business

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:48.880
not deserve some kind of apology from someone
who has taken their labor, taken the goods

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.609
that they produced, and then refused to pay
them?

00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:56.230
21:40 I can only say that I'm certainly relieved
that my late father never did business with

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.230
you.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:02.300
He provided a good middle-class life for us,
but the people he worked for, he expected

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.580
the bargain to be kept on both sides.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:12.310
And when we talk about your business, you've
taken business bankruptcy six times.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:18.119
There are a lot of great businesspeople that
have never taken bankruptcy once.

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:20.440
You call yourself the King of Debt.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.109
You talk about leverage.

00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:28.579
You even at one time suggested that you would
try to negotiate down the national debt of

00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:29.579
the United States.

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:30.579
TRUMP: Wrong.

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:31.579
Wrong.

00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:37.200
CLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct
transfer of skills from business to government,

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.550
but sometimes what happened in business would
be really bad for government.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.550
HOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.900
CLINTON: And we need to be very clear about
that.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.510
TRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's
time.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.550
Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.900
I built an unbelievable company.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.500
Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the
world, real estate assets anywhere in the

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.320
world, beyond the United States, in Europe,
lots of different places.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.690
It's an unbelievable company.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:08.090
But on occasion, four times, we used certain
laws that are there.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:14.500
And when Secretary Clinton talks about people
that didn't get paid, first of all, they did

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.500
get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the
laws of the nation.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.350
Now, if you want to change the laws, you've
been there a long time, change the laws.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:27.440
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation
because I'm running a company.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:33.530
My obligation right now is to do well for
myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.970
And that's what I do.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:41.320
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands
of people that are unbelievably happy and

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320
that love me.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.730
I'll give you an example.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:49.470
We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue
right next to the White House, so if I don't

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:54.170
get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania
Avenue another.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.339
But we're opening the Old Post Office.

00:42:57.339 --> 00:43:01.450
Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous
money.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.780
I'm a year ahead of schedule.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.330
And that's what this country should be doing.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:10.500
We build roads and they cost two and three
and four times what they're supposed to cost.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.190
We buy products for our military and they
come in at costs that are so far above what

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.820
they were supposed to be, because we don't
have people that know what they're doing.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:23.849
When we look at the budget, the budget is
bad to a large extent because we have people

00:43:23.849 --> 00:43:28.630
that have no idea as to what to do and how
to buy.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:34.020
The Trump International is way under budget
and way ahead of schedule.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.609
And we should be able to do that for our country.

00:43:36.609 --> 00:43:40.380
HOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so
I want to move to our next segment.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.119
We move into our next segment talking about
America's direction.

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:44.940
And let's start by talking about race.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:49.700
The share of Americans who say race relations
are bad in this country is the highest it's

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:55.750
been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings
of African-Americans by police, as we've seen

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.390
recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:01.360
Race has been a big issue in this campaign,
and one of you is going to have to bridge

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.619
a very wide and bitter gap.

00:44:03.619 --> 00:44:05.950
So how do you heal the divide?

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.730
Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on
this.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.349
CLINTON: Well, you're right.

00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:16.089
Race remains a significant challenge in our
country.

00:44:16.089 --> 00:44:22.530
Unfortunately, race still determines too much,
often determines where people live, determines

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:27.589
what kind of education in their public schools
they can get, and, yes, it determines how

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:30.760
they're treated in the criminal justice system.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:36.390
We've just seen those two tragic examples
in both Tulsa and Charlotte.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.210
And we've got to do several things at the
same time.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:48.500
We have to restore trust between communities
and the police.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:55.510
We have to work to make sure that our police
are using the best training, the best techniques,

00:44:55.510 --> 00:45:03.040
that they're well prepared to use force only
when necessary.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:09.390
Everyone should be respected by the law, and
everyone should respect the law.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:13.430
CLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in
a lot of our neighborhoods.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:18.980
So I have, ever since the first day of my
campaign, called for criminal justice reform.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:24.950
I've laid out a platform that I think would
begin to remedy some of the problems we have

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.310
in the criminal justice system.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:32.500
But we also have to recognize, in addition
to the challenges that we face with policing,

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.930
21:45:35 there are so many good, brave police
officers who equally want reform.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:43.570
So we have to bring communities together in
order to begin working on that as a mutual

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:44.750
goal.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:49.520
And we've got to get guns out of the hands
of people who should not have them.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:55.690
The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death
of young African- American men, more than

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.829
the next nine causes put together.

00:45:58.829 --> 00:46:01.180
So we have to do two things, as I said.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.560
We have to restore trust.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.010
We have to work with the police.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:08.110
We have to make sure they respect the communities
and the communities respect them.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:13.670
And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence,
which is a big contributor to a lot of the

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.970
problems that we're seeing today.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.300
HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.370
How do you heal the divide?

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:23.270
TRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton
doesn't want to use a couple of words, and

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.280
that's law and order.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.060
And we need law and order.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.710
If we don't have it, we're not going to have
a country.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:36.250
And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte,
a city I love, a city where I have investments,

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:40.050
when I look at what's going on throughout
various parts of our country, whether it's

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:46.500
-- I mean, I can just keep naming them all
day long -- we need law and order in our country.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:52.600
I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement
of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.230
-- just came in.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:59.550
We have endorsements from, I think, almost
every police group, very -- I mean, a large

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.349
percentage of them in the United States.

00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:10.200
We have a situation where we have our inner
cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.280
living in he'll because it's so dangerous.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.180
You walk down the street, you get shot.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:24.900
21:47:17 In Chicago, they've had thousands
of shootings, thousands since January 1st.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.900
Thousands of shootings.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.540
And I'm saying, where is this?

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.410
Is this a war-torn country?

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.750
What are we doing?

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.720
And we have to stop the violence.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.190
We have to bring back law and order.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:39.890
In a place like Chicago, where thousands of
people have been killed, thousands over the

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:45.660
last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000
have been killed since Barack Obama became

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:51.110
president, over -- almost 4,000 people in
Chicago have been killed.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:53.050
We have to bring back law and order.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:58.130
Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago
you do stop and frisk, which worked very well,

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.790
Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in
New York.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.109
It brought the crime rate way down.

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:06.890
But you take the gun away from criminals that
shouldn't be having it.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.480
We have gangs roaming the street.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.370
And in many cases, they're illegally here,
illegal immigrants.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.370
And they have guns.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:15.820
And they shoot people.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.220
And we have to be very strong.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.200
And we have to be very vigilant.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.670
We have to be -- we have to know what we're
doing.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.960
Right now, our police, in many cases, are
afraid to do anything.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:33.430
We have to protect our inner cities, because
African-American communities are being decimated

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:34.430
by crime, decimated.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:37.310
HOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired,
but I do want to follow up.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:42.859
21:48:38 Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional
in New York, because it largely singled out

00:48:42.859 --> 00:48:44.849
black and Hispanic young men.

00:48:44.849 --> 00:48:46.400
TRUMP: No, you're wrong.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:52.880
It went before a judge, who was a very against-police
judge.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.920
It was taken away from her.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.859
And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go
forward with the case.

00:48:58.859 --> 00:49:00.150
They would have won an appeal.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:03.662
If you look at it, throughout the country,
there are many places where it's allowed.

00:49:03.662 --> 00:49:05.760
HOLT: The argument is that it's a form of
racial profiling.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.410
TRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to
take the guns away from these people that

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:12.550
have them and they are bad people that shouldn't
have them.

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:13.550
These are felons.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:18.400
These are people that are bad people that
shouldn't be -- 21:49:18 when you have 3,000

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:25.960
shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when
you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:32.760
guns, from the beginning of the presidency
of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.760
have stop-and-frisk.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.270
You need more police.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:39.609
You need a better community, you know, relation.

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:42.170
You don't have good community relations in
Chicago.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:43.170
It's terrible.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:44.390
I have property there.

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.470
It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:49.650
But when you look -- and Chicago's not the
only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.520
different places.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.140
You need better relationships.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.359
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:58.920
TRUMP: You need better relationships between
the communities and the police, because in

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.930
some cases, it's not good.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:05.670
But you look at Dallas, where the relationships
were really studied, the relationships were

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:14.650
really a beautiful thing, and then five police
officers were killed one night very violently.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.520
So there's some bad things going on.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.520
Some really bad things.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.520
HOLT: Secretary Clinton...

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.640
TRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law
and order.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:26.300
And we need law and order in the inner cities,
because the people that are most affected

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:30.350
by what's happening are African-American and
Hispanic people.

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:35.890
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians
are allowing to happen.

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:36.950
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:44.150
CLINTON: 21:50:36 Well, I've heard -- I've
heard Donald say this at his rallies, and

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:51.980
it's really unfortunate that he paints such
a dire negative picture of black communities

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.980
in our country.

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.980
TRUMP: Ugh.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:58.520
CLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black
church, the black businesses that employ so

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:04.910
many people, the opportunities that so many
families are working to provide for their

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.720
kids.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:11.920
There's a lot that we should be proud of and
we should be supporting and lifting up.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.859
But we do always have to make sure we keep
people safe.

00:51:15.859 --> 00:51:20.839
There are the right ways of doing it, and
then there are ways that are ineffective.

00:51:20.839 --> 00:51:27.950
Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional
and, in part, because it was ineffective.

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.480
It did not do what it needed to do.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.869
Now, I believe in community policing.

00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:38.150
And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of
what it was in 1991.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.520
Property crime is down 40 percent.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.960
We just don't want to see it creep back up.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:49.550
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:54.020
But there were some problems, some unintended
consequences.

00:51:54.020 --> 00:52:00.859
Too many young African-American and Latino
men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.

00:52:00.859 --> 00:52:06.040
And it's just a fact that if you're a young
African-American man and you do the same thing

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:13.900
as a young white man, you are more likely
to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:19.210
So we've got to address the systemic racism
in our criminal justice system.

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:22.810
21:52:20 We cannot just say law and order.

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:29.980
We have to say -- we have to come forward
with a plan that is going to divert people

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:35.290
from the criminal justice system, deal with
mandatory minimum sentences, which have put

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.730
too many people away for too long for doing
too little.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:41.550
We need to have more second chance programs.

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:46.240
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons
in the federal system; I want to see them

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.980
ended in the state system.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:53.480
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to
fill prison cells with young Americans.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.060
So there are some positive ways we can work
on this.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:04.570
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun
safety measures would assist us.

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:09.930
Right now -- and this is something Donald
has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.930
now, we've got too many military- style weapons
on the streets.

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:17.430
In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:24.089
We need comprehensive background checks, and
we need to keep guns out of the hands of those

00:53:24.089 --> 00:53:25.730
who will do harm.

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:31.730
And we finally need to pass a prohibition
on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:34.140
from being able to buy a gun in our country.

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:38.210
21:53:39 If you're too dangerous to fly, you
are too dangerous to buy a gun.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:41.640
So there are things we can do, and we ought
to do it in a bipartisan way.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.280
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said
we've got to do everything possible to improve

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.630
policing, to go right at implicit bias.

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:51.470
21:53:50 Do you believe that police are implicitly
biased against black people?

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:56.410
CLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is
a problem for everyone, not just police.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:03.310
I think, unfortunately, too many of us in
our great country jump to conclusions about

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:04.930
each other.

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:11.330
And therefore, I think we need all of us to
be asking hard questions about, you know,

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:14.099
why am I feeling this way?

00:54:14.099 --> 00:54:19.550
But when it comes to policing, since it can
have literally fatal consequences, I have

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:26.540
said, in my first budget, we would put money
into that budget to help us deal with implicit

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:30.080
bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:35.480
I've met with a group of very distinguished,
experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.600
They admit it's an issue.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.270
They've got a lot of concerns.

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:42.080
21:54:38 Mental health is one of the biggest
concerns, because now police are having to

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:46.230
handle a lot of really difficult mental health
problems on the street.

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:50.810
They want support, they want more training,
they want more assistance.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:55.490
And I think the federal government could be
in a position where we would offer and provide

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:56.490
that.

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:57.490
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:58.490
TRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.

00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:59.490
HOLT: Please.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:03.520
TRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of
people even within my own party want to give

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.119
certain rights to people on watch lists and
no- fly lists.

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:08.119
I agree with you.

00:55:08.119 --> 00:55:13.569
When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly
list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA,

00:55:13.569 --> 00:55:14.569
which I'm very proud of.

00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:17.849
These are very, very good people, and they're
protecting the Second Amendment.

00:55:17.849 --> 00:55:22.569
But I think we have to look very strongly
at no-fly lists and watch lists.

00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:25.470
And when people are on there, even if they
shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:27.829
help them legally, we'll help them get off.

00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:30.920
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:35.050
I do want to bring up the fact that you were
the one that brought up the words 21:55:33

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:38.590
super-predator about young black youth.

00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:42.970
And that's a term that I think was a -- it's
-- it's been horribly met, as you know.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.119
I think you've apologized for it.

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:47.980
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:52.540
And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know,
you're talking about takes guns away.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:56.600
Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from
gangs and people that use them.

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.670
And I don't think -- I really don't think
you disagree with me on this, if you want

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:00.670
to know the truth.

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:04.239
I think maybe there's a political reason why
you can't say it, but I really don't believe

00:56:04.239 --> 00:56:11.080
-- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had
2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.220
it down to 500 murders.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.780
Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.280
It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed
to be good?

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.820
But we went from 2,200 to 500.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.559
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.

00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:26.570
And it was terminated by current mayor.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:31.240
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact
on the safety of New York City.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.880
Tremendous beyond belief.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.140
So when you say it has no impact, it really
did.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.829
It had a very, very big impact.

00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:41.630
CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're
going to talk about mayors, that under the

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:45.190
current mayor, crime has continued to drop,
including murders.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:46.190
So there is...

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:47.190
TRUMP: No, you're wrong.

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.190
You're wrong.

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:49.190
CLINTON: No, I'm not.

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:50.190
TRUMP: Murders are up.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:51.190
All right.

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:52.190
You check it.

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:53.190
CLINTON: New York -- New York has done an
excellent job.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:58.520
And I give credit -- I give credit across
the board going back two mayors, two police

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.480
chiefs, because it has worked.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.570
And other communities need to come together
to do what will work, as well.

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:09.069
Look, one murder is too many.

00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:14.180
But it is important that we learn about what
has been effective.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:19.730
And not go to things that sound good that
really did not have the kind of impact that

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:21.510
we would want.

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:24.270
Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?

00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:31.830
But let's also add, 21:57:30 no one should
disagree about respecting the rights of young

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.920
men who live in those neighborhoods.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:41.800
And so we need to do a better job of working,
again, with the communities, faith communities,

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.819
business communities, as well as the police
to try to deal with this problem.

00:57:45.819 --> 00:57:47.290
HOLT: This conversation is about race.

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:48.690
And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:49.940
TRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:50.940
HOLT: Please -- 20 seconds.

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:52.390
TRUMP: I'd just like to respond.

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:54.490
HOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick
follow-up for you.

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.490
TRUMP: I will.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:59.470
Look, the African-American community has been
let down by our politicians.

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:03.810
They talk good around election time, like
right now, and after the election, they said,

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:06.510
see ya later, I'll see you in four years.

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:11.770
The African-American community -- because
-- look, the community within the inner cities

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.880
has been so badly treated.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:20.559
They've been abused and used in order to get
votes by Democrat politicians, because that's

00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:21.559
what it is.

00:58:21.559 --> 00:58:23.900
They've controlled these communities for up
to 100 years.

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:26.210
(CROSSTALK)

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.210
CLINTON: Well, I -- I do think...

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:28.210
TRUMP: And I will tell you,

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:29.210
DONALD TRUMP: Nobody knows the system better
than me. I alone can fix it.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:30.210
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm going to close
my campaign focused on opportunities for kids

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.210
and fairness for families.

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.210
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary failed on the economy.
Everything she touched didn't work out, nothing.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:33.210
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Even if you're totally
opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:34.210
some questions about me.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.210
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:36.210
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:37.210
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour" special coverage
of the first debate between the two major-party

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:38.210
presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:39.210
The stage is set at Hofstra University on
Long Island, New York. With the election 43

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:40.210
days away the race tightening, a lot is on
the line tonight, Judy.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:41.210
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly is, Gwen, and
given that this is the first time these two

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:42.210
have faced each other one on one.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:43.210
Lester Holt of NBC News will be moderating.

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.210
Joining us at the table are our regular contributors,
syndicated columnist Mark Shields, New York

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:45.210
Times columnist David Brooks, and from The
Cook Political Report, Amy Walter.

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:46.210
We welcome all you have here for the next
two hours.

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:47.210
Amy, let's start with you.

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.210
What are you looking for?

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:49.210
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: Each
of these candidates has an enthusiasm gap

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:50.210
problem within their own party. So, they have
got to get their partisans fired up.

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:51.210
For Hillary Clinton, it's young people. For
Donald Trump, he's got to get those white

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:52.210
college-educated voters back into the Republican
fold, where they have been. And then they

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:53.210
have got to get those voters, both of them,
who are torn, don't like either choice they

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:54.210
have in front of them, to pick them.

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:55.210
GWEN IFILL: Mark Shields, what would you -- surprise
you the most of what these candidates might

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:56.210
or might not do tonight?

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.210
MARK SHIELDS: Does Donald Trump dare to be
boring? Does he come out sedated/presidential?

00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:58.210
And can Hillary Clinton, who is a marvelous
and superior deliverer of information, make

00:58:58.210 --> 00:58:59.210
an emotional connection with American voters?

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.210
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, what are you on the
edge of your seat looking for?

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:01.210
DAVID BROOKS: We have been around each other
too long. I wrote down emotional connection.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:02.210
(LAUGHTER)

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:03.210
MARK SHIELDS: Did you?

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:04.210
DAVID BROOKS: This is not a cognitive night.

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.210
This is not philosophy. This is not grand
strategy. It's moment of intimacy, that unscripted

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:06.210
moment when the unconscious is revealed that
will be replayed on YouTube over and over

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:07.210
and over again.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.210
And so it's just, is he commanding or is he
cruel? Is she relatable and does she seem

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:09.210
calmly smart? And it's whether people get
that vibe, the first they vibe, that will

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:10.210
determine the night.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:11.210
GWEN IFILL: Is this about what they know or
who they are?

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:12.210
AMY WALTER: Well, I think it's mostly about
who they are.

00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:13.210
For voters at this stage of the game, they
are looking up on that dais to see who they

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:14.210
can spend the next four years with, who they
want to invite into their homes moment after

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:15.210
moment.

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:16.210
Many voters say, I don't want either one of
them in there.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:17.210
GWEN IFILL: A lot of them.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:18.210
AMY WALTER: A lot of voters are saying that.

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:19.210
But this is the one maybe that they're not
going to like, but they will feel comfortable

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:20.210
enough.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:21.210
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, people are going
to be fact-checking this debate. They're going

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.210
to be raising questions about whether what
either one of them said was correct or not.

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.210
MARK SHIELDS: No, you're right, Judy.

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:24.210
And if it's what they know, it will be a short
evening...

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:25.210
(LAUGHTER)

00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:26.210
MARK SHIELDS: ... for the Republican nominee,
whose knowledge bank has been overdrawn.

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:27.210
And I think it's about, more than anything
else, each case, what does he know, his command

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:28.210
of it, is he comfortable with it, and who
she is. And I think that is really the question.

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:29.210
DAVID BROOKS: And there is the gender politics.

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.210
GWEN IFILL: OK.

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:31.210
Well, we're turning now to Lester Holt of
NBC News.

00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:32.210
TRANSCRIPT START

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:33.210
HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University
in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:34.210
of "NBC Nightly News." I want to welcome you
to the first presidential debate.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:35.210
The participants tonight are Donald Trump
and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:36.210
by the Commission on Presidential Debates,
a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:37.210
commission drafted tonight's format, and the
rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.

00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:38.210
The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments,
each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:39.210
topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity;
America's direction; and securing America.

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:40.210
At the start of each segment, I will ask the
same lead-off question to both candidates,

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:41.210
and they will each have up to two minutes
to respond. From that point until the end

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.210
of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:43.210
The questions are mine and have not been shared
with the commission or the campaigns. The

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:44.210
audience here in the room has agreed to remain
silent so that we can focus on what the candidates

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:45.210
are saying.

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.210
I will invite you to applaud, however, at
this moment, as we welcome the candidates:

00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:47.210
Democratic nominee for president of the United
States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.210
for president of the United States, Donald
J. Trump.

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.210
(APPLAUSE)

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:50.210
CLINTON: How are you, Donald?

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:51.210
(APPLAUSE)

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:52.210
HOLT: Good luck to you.

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:53.210
(APPLAUSE)

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.210
Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues
of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone,

00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:55.210
there are two more presidential debates scheduled.
We are going to focus on many of the issues

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:56.210
that voters tell us are most important, and
we're going to press for specifics. I am honored

00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:57.210
to have this role, but this evening belongs
to the candidates and, just as important,

00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:58.210
to the American people.

00:59:58.210 --> 00:59:59.210
Candidates, we look forward to hearing you
articulate your policies and your positions,

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:00.210
as well as your visions and your values. So,
let's begin.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:01.210
We're calling this opening segment "Achieving
Prosperity." And central to that is jobs.

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:02.210
There are two economic realities in America
today. There's been a record six straight

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:03.210
years of job growth, and new census numbers
show incomes have increased at a record rate

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:04.210
after years of stagnation. However, income
inequality remains significant, and nearly

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:05.210
half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.210
Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why
are you a better choice than your opponent

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.210
to create the kinds of jobs that will put
more money into the pockets of American works?

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:08.210
CLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks
to Hofstra for hosting us.

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.210
The central question in this election is really
what kind of country we want to be and what

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:10.210
kind of future we'll build together. Today
is my granddaughter's second birthday, so

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:11.210
I think about this a lot. First, we have to
build an economy that works for everyone,

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.210
not just those at the top. That means we need
new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:13.210
I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest
in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure,

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:14.210
in advanced manufacturing, innovation and
technology, clean, renewable energy, and small

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.210
business, because most of the new jobs will
come from small business. We also have to

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:16.210
make the economy fairer. That starts with
raising the national minimum wage and also

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.210
guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's
work.

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:18.210
CLINTON: I also want to see more companies
do profit-sharing. If you help create the

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:19.210
profits, you should be able to share in them,
not just the executives at the top.

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.210
And I want us to do more to support people
who are struggling to balance family and work.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.210
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult
choices you face and the stresses that you're

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.210
under. So let's have paid family leave, earned
sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.210
child care and debt-free college.

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:24.210
How are we going to do it? We're going to
do it by having the wealthy pay their fair

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:25.210
share and close the corporate loopholes.

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:26.210
Finally, we tonight are on the stage together,
Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.210
with you. We're going to have a debate where
we are talking about the important issues

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:28.210
facing our country. You have to judge us,
who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.210
of the presidency, who can put into action
the plans that will make your life better.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.210
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote
on November 8th.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:32.210
Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It's
about putting money -- more money into the

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:33.210
pockets of American workers. You have up to
two minutes.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.210
TRUMP: 21:08:32 Thank you, Lester. Our jobs
are fleeing the country. They're going to

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:35.210
Mexico. They're going to many other countries.
You look at what China is doing to our country

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.210
in terms of making our product. They're devaluing
their currency, and there's nobody in our

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:37.210
government to fight them. And we have a very
good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.210
they're using our country as a piggy bank
to rebuild China, and many other countries

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.210
are doing the same thing.

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:40.210
So we're losing our good jobs, so many of
them. When you look at what's happening in

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:41.210
Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants
said it's the eighth wonder of the world.

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.210
They're building some of the biggest plants
anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated,

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:43.210
some of the best plants. With the United States,
as he said, not so much.

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.210
So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small
car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:45.210
Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving.
And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:46.210
far as child care is concerned and so many
other things, I think Hillary and I agree

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:47.210
on that. We probably disagree a little bit
as to numbers and amounts and what we're going

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.210
to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about
that later.

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:49.210
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen
from us. We have to stop our companies from

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.210
leaving the United States and, with it, firing
all of their people. All you have to do is

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:51.210
take a look at Carrier air conditioning in
Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people.

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:52.210
They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds
and hundreds of companies are doing this.

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.210
TRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan,
I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:54.210
35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small
and big businesses. That's going to be a job

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:55.210
creator like we haven't seen since Ronald
Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:56.210
to watch.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.210
Companies will come. They will build. They
will expand. New companies will start. And

01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.210
I look very, very much forward to doing it.
We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and

01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:59.210
we have to stop these countries from stealing
our companies and our jobs.

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:00.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to
respond?

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:01.210
CLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important
issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the

01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:02.210
world's population; we have to trade with
the other 95 percent. And we need to have

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:03.210
smart, fair trade deals.

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:04.210
We also, though, need to have a tax system
that rewards work and not just financial transactions.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:05.210
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth
would be trickle-down economics all over again.

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.210
In fact, it would be the most extreme version,
the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:07.210
the people in this country than we've ever
had.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:08.210
I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because
that's exactly what it would be. That is not

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:09.210
how we grow the economy.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:10.210
We just have a different view about what's
best for growing the economy, how we make

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:11.210
investments that will actually produce jobs
and rising incomes.

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.210
I think we come at it from somewhat different
perspectives. I understand that. You know,

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.210
Donald was very fortunate in his life, and
that's all to his benefit. He started his

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:14.210
business with $14 million, borrowed from his
father, and he really believes that the more

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.210
you help wealthy people, the better off we'll
be and that everything will work out from

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.210
there.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:17.210
I don't buy that. I have a different experience.
My father was a small-businessman. He worked

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.210
really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on
long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:19.210
and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped
the paint in and took the squeegee and kept

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:20.210
going.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.210
And so what I believe is the more we can do
for the middle class, the more we can invest

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.210
in you, your education, your skills, your
future, the better we will be off and the

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.210
better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy
I want us to see again. 21:12:21

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.210
HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if
you can. You've talked about creating 25 million

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:25.210
jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions
of jobs for Americans. How are you going to

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:26.210
bring back the industries that have left this
country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically,

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.210
are you going to tell American manufacturers
that you have to come back?

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.210
TRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we
start on that -- my father gave me a very

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:29.210
small loan in 1975, and I built it into a
company that's worth many, many billions of

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:30.210
dollars, with some of the greatest assets
in the world, and I say that only because

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.210
that's the kind of thinking that our country
needs.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:32.210
Our country's in deep trouble. We don't know
what we're doing when it comes to devaluations

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.210
and all of these countries all over the world,
especially China. They're the best, the best

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:34.210
ever at it. What they're doing to us is a
very, very sad thing.

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:35.210
So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate
our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.210
our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're
doing things that, frankly, we don't do.

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.210
Let me give you the example of Mexico. They
have a VAT tax. We're on a different system.

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:38.210
When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When
they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.210
When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's
a defective agreement. It's been defective

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.210
for a long time, many years, but the politicians
haven't done anything about it.

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:41.210
Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton
-- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:42.210
very happy. It's very important to me.

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:43.210
But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,
when she started talking about this, it was

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.210
really very recently. She's been doing this
for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:45.210
agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is
defective. Just because of the tax and many

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:46.210
other reasons, but just because of the fact...

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:47.210
HOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:48.210
TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians,
should have been doing this for years, not

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.210
right now, because of the fact that we've
created a movement. They should have been

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.210
doing this for years. What's happened to our
jobs and our country and our economy generally

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.210
is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot
do it any longer, Lester.

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.210
HOLT: 21:14:28 Back to the question, though.
How do you bring back -- specifically bring

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:53.210
back jobs, American manufacturers? How do
you make them bring the jobs back?

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.210
TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't
let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.210
I could name, I mean, there are thousands
of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:56.210
in bigger numbers than ever.

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.210
And what you do is you say, fine, you want
to go to Mexico or some other country, good

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:58.210
luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you
think you're going to make your air conditioners

01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.210
or your cars or your cookies or whatever you
make and bring them into our country without

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.210
a tax, you're wrong.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:01.210
And once you say you're going to have to tax
them coming in, and our politicians never

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:02.210
do this, because they have special interests
and the special interests want those companies

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.210
to leave, because in many cases, they own
the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:04.210
stop them from leaving. We have to stop them
from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:05.210
HOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in
here.

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:06.210
CLINTON: 21:15:19 Well, let's stop for a second
and remember where we were eight years ago.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.210
We had the worst financial crisis, the Great
Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:08.210
was in large part because of tax policies
that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:09.210
to invest in the middle class, took their
eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:10.210
storm.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.210
In fact, Donald was one of the people who
rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.210
in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because
then I can go in and buy some and make some

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:13.210
money." Well, it did collapse.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.210
TRUMP: 21:16:02 That's called business, by
the way.

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:15.210
CLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million
people lost their jobs. Five million people

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:16.210
lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family
wealth was wiped out.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.210
Now, we have come back from that abyss. And
it has not been easy. So we're now on the

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.210
precipice of having a potentially much better
economy, but the last thing we need to do

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:19.210
is to go back to the policies that failed
us in the first place.

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:20.210
Independent experts have looked at what I've
proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed,

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.210
and basically they've said this, that if his
tax plan, which would blow up the debt by

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.210
over $5 trillion and would in some instances
disadvantage middle-class families compared

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:23.210
to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we
would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:24.210
another recession.

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.210
They've looked at my plans and they've said,
OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:26.210
it done, we will have 10 million more new
jobs, because we will be making investments

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:27.210
where we can grow the economy. Take clean
energy. Some country is going to be the clean-

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.210
energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald
thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.210
by the Chinese. I think it's real.

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:30.210
TRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say
that.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:31.210
CLINTON: I think science is real.

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:32.210
TRUMP: I do not say that.

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.210
CLINTON: And I think it's important that we
grip this and deal with it, both at home and

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.210
abroad. And here's what we can do. We can
deploy a half a billion more solar panels.

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.210
We can have enough clean energy to power every
home. We can build a new modern electric grid.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.210
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new
economic activity.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.210
So I've tried to be very specific about what
we can and should do, and I am determined

01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:38.210
that we're going to get the economy really
moving again, building on the progress we've

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:39.210
made over the last eight years, but never
going back to what got us in trouble in the

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.210
first place.

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:41.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:42.210
TRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested
in a solar company, our country. That was

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:43.210
a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that
one.

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:44.210
Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms
of energy, but we're putting a lot of people

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:45.210
out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster.
Our country is losing so much in terms of

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:46.210
energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You
can't do what you're looking to do with $20

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:47.210
trillion in debt.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:48.210
The Obama administration, from the time they've
come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt,

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:49.210
and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course
of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years,

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:50.210
to be semi- exact.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:51.210
So I will tell you this. We have to do a much
better job at keeping our jobs. And we have

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.210
to do a much better job at giving companies
incentives to build new companies or to expand,

01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:53.210
because they're not doing it.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:54.210
21:18:59 And all you have to do is look at
Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:55.210
of these places where so many of their jobs
and their companies are just leaving, they're

01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:56.210
gone.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:57.210
And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've
been doing this for 30 years. Why are you

01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.210
just thinking about these solutions right
now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and

01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.210
now you're just starting to think of solutions.

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.210
CLINTON: Well, actually...

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.210
TRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring
back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.210
CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about
this quite a bit.

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.210
TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:04.210
CLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that
long. I think my husband did a pretty good

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:05.210
job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what
worked and how we can make it work again...

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:06.210
TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:07.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:08.210
CLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced
budget...

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:09.210
TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single
worst trade deal ever approved in this country.

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.210
CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing
jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:11.210
going to look at the facts.

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.210
When I was in the Senate, I had a number of
trade deals that came before me, and I held

01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:13.210
them all to the same test. Will they create
jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:14.210
America? And are they good for our national
security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:15.210
one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I
voted against. And because I hold the same

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:16.210
standards as I look at all of these trade
deals.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:17.210
But let's not assume that trade is the only
challenge we have in the economy. I think

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:18.210
it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm
going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor.

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.210
We're going to enforce the trade deals we
have, and we're going to hold people accountable.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.210
When I was secretary of state, we actually
increased American exports globally 30 percent.

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:21.210
We increased them to China 50 percent. So
I know how to really work to get new jobs

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.210
and to get exports that helped to create more
new jobs.

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:23.210
HOLT: Very quickly...

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:24.210
TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years
or 26 years or any number you want to...

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.210
CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:26.210
TRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done
it.

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:27.210
CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:28.210
TRUMP: Excuse me.

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:29.210
CLINTON: And I have done a lot...

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:30.210
TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was
one of the worst things that ever happened

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.210
to the manufacturing industry.

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:32.210
CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is
your opinion.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:33.210
TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio,
Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.210
Clinton, and you will see devastation where
manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.210
NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed
anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this

01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:36.210
country.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:37.210
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific
Partnership. You were totally in favor of

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.210
it. Then you heard what I was saying, how
bad it is, and you said, I can't win that

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:39.210
debate. But you know that if you did win,
you would approve that, and that will be almost

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.210
as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:41.210
CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate.
I was against it once it was finally negotiated

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:42.210
and the terms were laid out. I wrote about
that in...

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.210
TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:45.210
TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of
trade deals. You said it's the finest deal

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.210
you've ever seen.

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:47.210
CLINTON: No.

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.210
TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about
it, and all of a sudden you were against it.

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:49.210
CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in
your own reality, but that is not the facts.

01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:50.210
The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would
be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.210
TRUMP: Not.

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:52.210
CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for,
I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:53.210
in my book...

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:54.210
TRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?

01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:55.210
CLINTON: ... before you even announced.

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:56.210
TRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?

01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:57.210
CLINTON: Look, there are differences...

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:58.210
TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's
fault?

01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.210
CLINTON: There are...

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.210
TRUMP: Because he's pushing it.

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:01.210
CLINTON: There are different views about what's
good for our country, our economy, and our

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:02.210
leadership in the world. And I think it's
important to look at what we need to do to

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:03.210
get the economy going again. That's why I
said new jobs with rising incomes, investments,

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:04.210
not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion
to the debt.

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:05.210
TRUMP: But you have no plan.

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:06.210
CLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.210
TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.210
CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about
it. It's called "Stronger Together." You can

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:09.210
pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:10.210
TRUMP: That's about all you've...

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:11.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:12.210
HOLT: Folks, we're going to...

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:13.210
CLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:14.210
HOLT: We're going to move to...

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:15.210
CLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we
need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained

01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:16.210
growth. We also have to look at how we help
families balance the responsibilities at home

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.210
and the responsibilities at business.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.210
So we have a very robust set of plans. And
people have looked at both of our plans, have

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:19.210
concluded that mine would create 10 million
jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs,

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.210
and explode the debt which would have a recession.

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:21.210
TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the
biggest tax cuts in history. 21:23:20 You

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:22.210
are going to approve one of the biggest tax
increases in history. You are going to drive

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:23.210
business out. Your regulations are a disaster,
and you're going to increase regulations all

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:24.210
over the place.

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:25.210
And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest
since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it.

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:26.210
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.
But regulations, you are going to regulate

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:27.210
these businesses out of existence.

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.210
When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this,
I've been all over. And when I go around,

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.210
despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things
that business as in people like the most is

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:30.210
the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You
have regulations on top of regulations, and

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:31.210
new companies cannot form and old companies
are going out of business. And you want to

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:32.210
increase the regulations and make them even
worse.

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:33.210
I'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to
cut taxes big league, and you're going to

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.210
raise taxes big league, end of story.

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.210
HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there,
because we're going to move into -- we're

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:36.210
going to move into the next segment. We're
going to talk taxes...

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:37.210
CLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left
to stand.

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:38.210
HOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then
we're going to go on.

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:39.210
CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would
be a lot of these charges and claims, and

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:40.210
so...

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.210
TRUMP: Facts.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.210
CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of
my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.210
turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want
to see in real-time what the facts are, please

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:44.210
go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:45.210
TRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and
you'll see.

01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.210
CLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the
debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:47.210
to the debt. What I have proposed would cut
regulations and streamline them for small

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:48.210
businesses. What I have proposed would be
paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy,

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:49.210
because they have made all the gains in the
economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:50.210
and corporations paid their fair share to
support this country.

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:51.210
HOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.

01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:52.210
TRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think
I...

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:53.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:54.210
HOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right
here...

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:55.210
TRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website,
and you take a look at her website.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:56.210
HOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:57.210
TRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.

01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:58.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...

01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.210
TRUMP: And look at her website. You know what?
It's no difference than this. She's telling

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:00.210
us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website.
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.210
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would
like that too much.

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:02.210
HOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:03.210
CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight
ISIS.

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:04.210
HOLT: ... achieving prosperity...

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:05.210
TRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything
you want to do.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:06.210
CLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:07.210
TRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything
you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:08.210
-- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your
entire adult life.

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:09.210
CLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please,
fact checkers, get to work.

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:10.210
HOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And
we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.210
And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental
difference between the two of you concerns

01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:12.210
the wealthy.

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:13.210
Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax
increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:14.210
like you to further defend that. And, Mr.
Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.210
wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And
this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr.

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:16.210
Trump.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.210
TRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major
jobs, because the wealthy are going create

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:18.210
tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their
companies. They're going to do a tremendous

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.210
job.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:20.210
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.
And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's

01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:21.210
really not a great thing for the wealthy.
It's a great thing for the middle class. It's

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:22.210
a great thing for companies to expand.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.210
And when these people are going to put billions
and billions of dollars into companies, and

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:24.210
when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion
back from overseas, where they can't bring

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.210
the money back, because politicians like Secretary
Clinton won't allow them to bring the money

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:26.210
back, because the taxes are so onerous, and
the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:27.210
bad.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:28.210
So what they're doing is they're leaving our
country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.210
because taxes are too high and because some
of them have lots of money outside of our

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:30.210
country. And instead of bringing it back and
putting the money to work, because they can't

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:31.210
work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees
it should be brought back.

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:32.210
Instead of that, they're leaving our country
to get their money, because they can't bring

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:33.210
their money back into our country, because
of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't

01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:34.210
get together. Because we have -- we have a
president that can't sit them around a table

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:35.210
and get them to approve something.

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:36.210
And here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats
agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:37.210
I happen to think it's double that. It's probably
$5 trillion that we can't bring into our country,

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.210
Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd
get it in here very quickly, and it could

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:39.210
be put to use on the inner cities and lots
of other things, and it would be beautiful.

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:40.210
But we have no leadership. And honestly, that
starts with Secretary Clinton. 21:28:01

01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:41.210
HOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the
same question to defend tax increases on the

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.210
wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:43.210
CLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end
of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.210
everything that's ever happened.

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:45.210
TRUMP: Why not?

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:46.210
CLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:47.210
(LAUGHTER)

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.210
You know, just join the debate by saying more
crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.210
absolutely the case...

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:50.210
TRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting
our companies bring their money back into

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:51.210
their country.

01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:52.210
HOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's
two minutes, please.

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:53.210
TRUMP: Yes.

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:54.210
CLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock
again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals.

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:55.210
I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates
or the kinds of proposals you're referring

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.210
to that would cause the repatriation, bringing
back of money that's stranded overseas. I

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:57.210
happen to support that.

01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:58.210
TRUMP: Then you didn't read it.

01:05:58.210 --> 01:05:59.210
CLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support
that in a way that will actually work to our

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:00.210
benefit. But when I look at what you have
proposed, you have what is called now the

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.210
21:29:01 Trump loophole, because it would
so advantage you and the business you do.

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:02.210
You've proposed an approach that has a...

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:03.210
TRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've
-- who gave it that name?

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:04.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's
two minutes.

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:06.210
CLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your
family. And when you look at what you are

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:07.210
proposing...

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.210
TRUMP: How much? How much for my family?

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:09.210
CLINTON: ... it is...

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:10.210
TRUMP: Lester, how much?

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:11.210
CLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.
Trickle-down did not work. It got us into

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:12.210
the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing
taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:13.210
And a lot of really smart, wealthy people
know that. And they are saying, hey, we need

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:14.210
to do more to make the contributions we should
be making to rebuild the middle class.

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:15.210
CLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America.
I think building the middle class, investing

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:16.210
in the middle class, making college debt-free
so more young people can get their education,

01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.210
helping people refinance their -- their debt
from college at a lower rate. Those are the

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:18.210
kinds of things that will really boost the
economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:19.210
what we need in America, not more advantages
for people at the very top.

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:20.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.210
TRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action.
Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.210
happen. Our country is suffering because people
like Secretary Clinton have made such bad

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:23.210
decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms
of what's going on.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:24.210
Now, look, we have the worst revival of an
economy since the Great Depression. And believe

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:25.210
me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only
thing that looks good is the stock market,

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.210
but if you raise interest rates even a little
bit, that's going to come crashing down.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:27.210
We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we
better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed

01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:28.210
that's doing political things. This Janet
Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:29.210
-- by keeping the interest rates at this level.
And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:30.210
he leaves, and goes out to the golf course
for the rest of his life to play golf 21:31:00,

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:31.210
when they raise interest rates, you're going
to see some very bad things happen, because

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:32.210
the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is
being more political than Secretary Clinton.

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:33.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden
that Americans have to pay, yet you have not

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:34.210
released your tax returns. And the reason
nominees have released their returns for decades

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.210
is so that voters will know if their potential
president owes money to -- who he owes it

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:36.210
to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans
have a right to know if there are any conflicts

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:37.210
of interest?

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:38.210
TRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under
a routine audit. And it'll be released. And

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:39.210
-- as soon as the audit's finished, it will
be released.

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:40.210
But you will learn more about Donald Trump
by going down to the federal elections, where

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:41.210
I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement
of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.210
income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked
today -- the income is filed at $694 million

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.210
for this past year, $694 million. If you would
have told me I was going to make that 15 or

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:44.210
20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:45.210
But that's the kind of thinking that our country
needs. When we have a country that's doing

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.210
so badly, that's being ripped off by every
single country in the world, it's the kind

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:47.210
of thinking that our country needs, because
everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.210
with all of the countries that we do business
with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.210
what that is? That means, who's negotiating
these trade deals?

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:50.210
We have people that are political hacks negotiating
our trade deals.

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:51.210
HOLT: The IRS says an audit...

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:52.210
TRUMP: Excuse me.

01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:53.210
HOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly
free to release your taxes during an audit.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.210
And so the question, does the public's right
to know outweigh your personal...

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.210
TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them
as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.210
audit almost for 15 years. 21:33:00 I know
a lot of wealthy people that have never been

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.210
audited. I said, do you get audited? I get
audited almost every year.

01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:58.210
And in a way, I should be complaining. I'm
not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's

01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:59.210
almost become a way of life. I get audited
by the IRS. But other people don't.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:00.210
I will say this. We have a situation in this
country that has to be taken care of. I will

01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:01.210
release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's
wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:02.210
that have been deleted. As soon as she releases
them, I will release.

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:03.210
(APPLAUSE)

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:04.210
I will release my tax returns. And that's
against -- my lawyers, they say, "Don't do

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.210
it." I will tell you this. No -- in fact,
watching shows, they're reading the papers.

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:06.210
Almost every lawyer says, you don't release
your returns until the audit's complete. When

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.210
the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would
go against them if she releases her e-mails.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:08.210
HOLT: So it's negotiable?

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:09.210
TRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release
the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:10.210
HOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But
let me just admonish the audience one more

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:11.210
time. There was an agreement. We did ask you
to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:12.210
Secretary Clinton?

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:13.210
CLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another
example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years,

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:14.210
everyone running for president has released
their tax returns. You can go and see nearly,

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:15.210
I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns,
but everyone has done it. We know the IRS

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:16.210
has made clear there is no prohibition on
releasing it when you're under audit.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:17.210
So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he
release his tax returns? And I think there

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:18.210
may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's
not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:19.210
he's not as charitable as he claims to be.

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:20.210
CLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business
dealings, but we have been told through investigative

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:21.210
reporting that he owes about $650 million
to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:22.210
he doesn't want the American people, all of
you watching tonight, to know that he's paid

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.210
nothing in federal taxes, because the only
years that anybody's ever seen were a couple

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:24.210
of years when he had to turn them over to
state authorities when he was trying to get

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.210
a casino license, and they showed he didn't
pay any federal income tax.

01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:26.210
21:35:27 TRUMP: That makes me smart.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.210
CLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means
zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.210
or health. And I think probably he's not all
that enthusiastic about having the rest of

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.210
our country see what the real reasons are,
because it must be something really important,

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.210
even terrible, that he's trying to hide.

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.210
And the financial disclosure statements, they
don't give you the tax rate. They don't give

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.210
you all the details that tax returns would.
And it just seems to me that this is something

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.210
that the American people deserve to see. And
I have no reason to believe that he's ever

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:34.210
going to release his tax returns, because
there's something he's hiding.

01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:35.210
And we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what
it might be that he's hiding. But I think

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:36.210
the question is, were he ever to get near
the White House, what would be those conflicts?

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:37.210
Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you
the answers to that, and he should provide

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:38.210
them.

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:39.210
HOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue
of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:40.210
that?

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:41.210
CLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake
using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:42.210
sure.

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:43.210
CLINTON: And if I had to do it over again,
I would, obviously, do it differently. But

01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:44.210
I'm not going to make any excuses. It was
a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:45.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:46.210
TRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That
was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake.

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:47.210
That was done purposely. When you have your
staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:48.210
Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you
have the man that set up the illegal server

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:49.210
taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.
And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:50.210
thinks it's disgraceful, also.

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.210
As far as my tax returns, you don't learn
that much from tax returns. That I can tell

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:52.210
you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure.
And you should go down and take a look at

01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:53.210
that.

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:54.210
The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.
The report that said $650 -- which, by the

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:55.210
way, a lot of friends of mine that know my
business say, boy, that's really not a lot

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.210
of money. It's not a lot of money relative
to what I had.

01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:57.210
The buildings that were in question, they
said in the same report, which was -- actually,

01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:58.210
it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with
you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.

01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:59.210
And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's
not $650. It's much less than that.

01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:00.210
But I could give you a list of banks, I would
-- if that would help you, I would give you

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:01.210
a list of banks. These are very fine institutions,
very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:02.210
I am very underleveraged. I have a great company.
I have a tremendous income. And the reason

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:03.210
I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's
because it's about time that this country

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:04.210
had somebody running it that has an idea about
money.

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.210
When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our
country's a mess, you know, it's one thing

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:06.210
to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads
are good and our bridges are good and everything's

01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:07.210
in great shape, our airports. 21:38:25 Our
airports are like from a third world country.

01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:08.210
You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy,
you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:09.210
come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these
incredible -- you come in from China, you

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:10.210
see these incredible airports, and you land
-- we've become a third world country.

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:11.210
So the worst of all things has happened. We
owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:12.210
even started. And we've spent $6 trillion
in the Middle East, according to a report

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:13.210
that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but
it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:14.210
East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:15.210
And it's really a shame. And it's politicians
like Secretary Clinton that have caused this

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:16.210
problem. Our country has tremendous problems.
We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:17.210
nation. And we have a country that needs new
roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports,

01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:18.210
new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have
the money, because it's been squandered on

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:19.210
so many of your ideas.

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:20.210
HOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move
on to the next segment.

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:21.210
CLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid
any federal income tax for a lot of years.

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:22.210
(APPLAUSE)

01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:23.210
And the other thing I think is important...

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:24.210
TRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe
me.

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:25.210
CLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim
to be president of the United States is your

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:26.210
business, then I think we should talk about
that. You know, your campaign manager said

01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:27.210
that you built a lot of businesses on the
backs of little guys.

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:28.210
And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people
who were stiffed by you and your businesses,

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:29.210
Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects,
glass installers, marble installers, drapery

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.210
installers, like my dad was, who you refused
to pay when they finished the work that you

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:31.210
asked them to do.

01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:32.210
We have an architect in the audience who designed
one of your clubhouses at one of your golf

01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:33.210
courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately
was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.210
the man needed to be paid, what he was charging
you to do...

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.210
TRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I
was unsatisfied with his work...

01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:36.210
CLINTON: Well, to...

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:37.210
TRUMP: Which our country should do, too.

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:38.210
CLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you
have stiffed over the course of your business

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:39.210
not deserve some kind of apology from someone
who has taken their labor, taken the goods

01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:40.210
that they produced, and then refused to pay
them?

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.210
21:40 I can only say that I'm certainly relieved
that my late father never did business with

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.210
you. He provided a good middle-class life
for us, but the people he worked for, he expected

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:43.210
the bargain to be kept on both sides.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:44.210
And when we talk about your business, you've
taken business bankruptcy six times. There

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:45.210
are a lot of great businesspeople that have
never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:46.210
the King of Debt. You talk about leverage.
You even at one time suggested that you would

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:47.210
try to negotiate down the national debt of
the United States.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.210
TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:49.210
CLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct
transfer of skills from business to government,

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:50.210
but sometimes what happened in business would
be really bad for government.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.210
HOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.210
CLINTON: And we need to be very clear about
that.

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.210
TRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's
time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:54.210
bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some
of the greatest assets anywhere in the world,

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:55.210
real estate assets anywhere in the world,
beyond the United States, in Europe, lots

01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:56.210
of different places. It's an unbelievable
company.

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.210
But on occasion, four times, we used certain
laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton

01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:58.210
talks about people that didn't get paid, first
of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken

01:08:58.210 --> 01:08:59.210
advantage of the laws of the nation.

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:00.210
Now, if you want to change the laws, you've
been there a long time, change the laws. But

01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:01.210
I take advantage of the laws of the nation
because I'm running a company. My obligation

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:02.210
right now is to do well for myself, my family,
my employees, for my companies. And that's

01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:03.210
what I do.

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:04.210
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands
of people that are unbelievably happy and

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:05.210
that love me. I'll give you an example. We're
just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:06.210
next to the White House, so if I don't get
there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:07.210
Avenue another.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.210
But we're opening the Old Post Office. Under
budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.210
money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's
what this country should be doing.

01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:10.210
We build roads and they cost two and three
and four times what they're supposed to cost.

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:11.210
We buy products for our military and they
come in at costs that are so far above what

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:12.210
they were supposed to be, because we don't
have people that know what they're doing.

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:13.210
When we look at the budget, the budget is
bad to a large extent because we have people

01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:14.210
that have no idea as to what to do and how
to buy. The Trump International is way under

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:15.210
budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should
be able to do that for our country.

01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:16.210
HOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so
I want to move to our next segment. We move

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:17.210
into our next segment talking about America's
direction. And let's start by talking about

01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:18.210
race.

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:19.210
The share of Americans who say race relations
are bad in this country is the highest it's

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:20.210
been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings
of African-Americans by police, as we've seen

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:21.210
recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has
been a big issue in this campaign, and one

01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:22.210
of you is going to have to bridge a very wide
and bitter gap.

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:23.210
So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton,
you get two minutes on this.

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:24.210
CLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains
a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately,

01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:25.210
race still determines too much, often determines
where people live, determines what kind of

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:26.210
education in their public schools they can
get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.210
in the criminal justice system. We've just
seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.210
and Charlotte.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:29.210
And we've got to do several things at the
same time. We have to restore trust between

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:30.210
communities and the police. We have to work
to make sure that our police are using the

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.210
best training, the best techniques, that they're
well prepared to use force only when necessary.

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:32.210
Everyone should be respected by the law, and
everyone should respect the law.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.210
CLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in
a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:34.210
since the first day of my campaign, called
for criminal justice reform. I've laid out

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:35.210
a platform that I think would begin to remedy
some of the problems we have in the criminal

01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:36.210
justice system.

01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:37.210
But we also have to recognize, in addition
to the challenges that we face with policing,

01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:38.210
21:45:35 there are so many good, brave police
officers who equally want reform. So we have

01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:39.210
to bring communities together in order to
begin working on that as a mutual goal. And

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:40.210
we've got to get guns out of the hands of
people who should not have them.

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:41.210
The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death
of young African- American men, more than

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.210
the next nine causes put together. So we have
to do two things, as I said. We have to restore

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:43.210
trust. We have to work with the police. We
have to make sure they respect the communities

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:44.210
and the communities respect them. And we have
to tackle the plague of gun violence, which

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.210
is a big contributor to a lot of the problems
that we're seeing today.

01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:46.210
HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
How do you heal the divide?

01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:47.210
TRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton
doesn't want to use a couple of words, and

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:48.210
that's law and order. And we need law and
order. If we don't have it, we're not going

01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:49.210
to have a country.

01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:50.210
And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte,
a city I love, a city where I have investments,

01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.210
when I look at what's going on throughout
various parts of our country, whether it's

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:52.210
-- I mean, I can just keep naming them all
day long -- we need law and order in our country.

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:53.210
I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement
of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.210
-- just came in. We have endorsements from,
I think, almost every police group, very -- I

01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:55.210
mean, a large percentage of them in the United
States.

01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:56.210
We have a situation where we have our inner
cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are

01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:57.210
living in he'll because it's so dangerous.
You walk down the street, you get shot.

01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:58.210
21:47:17 In Chicago, they've had thousands
of shootings, thousands since January 1st.

01:09:58.210 --> 01:09:59.210
Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where
is this? Is this a war-torn country? What

01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.210
are we doing? And we have to stop the violence.
We have to bring back law and order. In a

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:01.210
place like Chicago, where thousands of people
have been killed, thousands over the last

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:02.210
number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have
been killed since Barack Obama became president,

01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:03.210
over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have
been killed. We have to bring back law and

01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:04.210
order.

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:05.210
Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago
you do stop and frisk, which worked very well,

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:06.210
Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in
New York. It brought the crime rate way down.

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.210
But you take the gun away from criminals that
shouldn't be having it.

01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:08.210
We have gangs roaming the street. And in many
cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.

01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:09.210
And they have guns. And they shoot people.
And we have to be very strong. And we have

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.210
to be very vigilant.

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:11.210
We have to be -- we have to know what we're
doing. Right now, our police, in many cases,

01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.210
are afraid to do anything. We have to protect
our inner cities, because African-American

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:13.210
communities are being decimated by crime,
decimated.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:14.210
HOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired,
but I do want to follow up. 21:48:38 Stop-and-frisk

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.210
was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because
it largely singled out black and Hispanic

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.210
young men.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:17.210
TRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a
judge, who was a very against-police judge.

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:18.210
It was taken away from her. And our mayor,
our new mayor, refused to go forward with

01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:19.210
the case. They would have won an appeal. If
you look at it, throughout the country, there

01:10:19.210 --> 01:10:20.210
are many places where it's allowed.

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:21.210
HOLT: The argument is that it's a form of
racial profiling.

01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:22.210
TRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to
take the guns away from these people that

01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:23.210
have them and they are bad people that shouldn't
have them.

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.210
These are felons. These are people that are
bad people that shouldn't be -- 21:49:18 when

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:25.210
you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January
1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:26.210
Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the
presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown,

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.210
you have to have stop-and-frisk.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:28.210
You need more police. You need a better community,
you know, relation. You don't have good community

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.210
relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have
property there. It's terrible what's going

01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:30.210
on in Chicago.

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:31.210
But when you look -- and Chicago's not the
only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:32.210
different places. You need better relationships.
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:33.210
TRUMP: You need better relationships between
the communities and the police, because in

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:34.210
some cases, it's not good.

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:35.210
But you look at Dallas, where the relationships
were really studied, the relationships were

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:36.210
really a beautiful thing, and then five police
officers were killed one night very violently.

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:37.210
So there's some bad things going on. Some
really bad things.

01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton...

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:39.210
TRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law
and order. And we need law and order in the

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.210
inner cities, because the people that are
most affected by what's happening are African-American

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:41.210
and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair
to them what our politicians are allowing

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.210
to happen.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:44.210
CLINTON: 21:50:36 Well, I've heard -- I've
heard Donald say this at his rallies, and

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:45.210
it's really unfortunate that he paints such
a dire negative picture of black communities

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:46.210
in our country.

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:47.210
TRUMP: Ugh.

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:48.210
CLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black
church, the black businesses that employ so

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.210
many people, the opportunities that so many
families are working to provide for their

01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:50.210
kids. There's a lot that we should be proud
of and we should be supporting and lifting

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:51.210
up.

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:52.210
But we do always have to make sure we keep
people safe. There are the right ways of doing

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:53.210
it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.
Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.210
and, in part, because it was ineffective.
It did not do what it needed to do.

01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:55.210
Now, I believe in community policing. And,
in fact, violent crime is one-half of what

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.210
it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40
percent. We just don't want to see it creep

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:57.210
back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.

01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:58.210
But there were some problems, some unintended
consequences. Too many young African-American

01:10:58.210 --> 01:10:59.210
and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent
offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:00.210
a young African-American man and you do the
same thing as a young white man, you are more

01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:01.210
likely to be arrested, charged, convicted,
and incarcerated. So we've got to address

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:02.210
the systemic racism in our criminal justice
system. 21:52:20 We cannot just say law and

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.210
order. We have to say -- we have to come forward
with a plan that is going to divert people

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:04.210
from the criminal justice system, deal with
mandatory minimum sentences, which have put

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.210
too many people away for too long for doing
too little.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.210
We need to have more second chance programs.
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:07.210
in the federal system; I want to see them
ended in the state system. You shouldn't have

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:08.210
a profit motivation to fill prison cells with
young Americans. So there are some positive

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:09.210
ways we can work on this.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:10.210
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun
safety measures would assist us. Right now

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.210
-- and this is something Donald has supported,
along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:12.210
got too many military- style weapons on the
streets. In a lot of places, our police are

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:13.210
outgunned. We need comprehensive background
checks, and we need to keep guns out of the

01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:14.210
hands of those who will do harm.

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:15.210
And we finally need to pass a prohibition
on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.210
from being able to buy a gun in our country.
21:53:39 If you're too dangerous to fly, you

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:17.210
are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are
things we can do, and we ought to do it in

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.210
a bipartisan way.

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said
we've got to do everything possible to improve

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:20.210
policing, to go right at implicit bias. 21:53:50
Do you believe that police are implicitly

01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:21.210
biased against black people?

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.210
CLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is
a problem for everyone, not just police. I

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:23.210
think, unfortunately, too many of us in our
great country jump to conclusions about each

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:24.210
other. And therefore, I think we need all
of us to be asking hard questions about, you

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.210
know, why am I feeling this way?

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:26.210
But when it comes to policing, since it can
have literally fatal consequences, I have

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:27.210
said, in my first budget, we would put money
into that budget to help us deal with implicit

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:28.210
bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:29.210
I've met with a group of very distinguished,
experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:30.210
They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot
of concerns. 21:54:38 Mental health is one

01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:31.210
of the biggest concerns, because now police
are having to handle a lot of really difficult

01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:32.210
mental health problems on the street.

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:33.210
They want support, they want more training,
they want more assistance. And I think the

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.210
federal government could be in a position
where we would offer and provide that.

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:35.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:36.210
TRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:37.210
HOLT: Please.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.210
TRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of
people even within my own party want to give

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.210
certain rights to people on watch lists and
no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.210
is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I
have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm

01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:41.210
very proud of. These are very, very good people,
and they're protecting the Second Amendment.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:42.210
But I think we have to look very strongly
at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.210
people are on there, even if they shouldn't
be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them

01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:44.210
legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend
to agree with that quite strongly.

01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:45.210
I do want to bring up the fact that you were
the one that brought up the words 21:55:33

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.210
super-predator about young black youth. And
that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:47.210
been horribly met, as you know. I think you've
apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:48.210
thing to say.

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:49.210
And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know,
you're talking about takes guns away. Well,

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:50.210
I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs
and people that use them. And I don't think

01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:51.210
-- I really don't think you disagree with
me on this, if you want to know the truth.

01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:52.210
I think maybe there's a political reason why
you can't say it, but I really don't believe

01:11:52.210 --> 01:11:53.210
-- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had
2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:54.210
it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders
is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe,

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:55.210
500 is like supposed to be good?

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:56.210
But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was
continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was

01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:57.210
terminated by current mayor. But stop-and-
frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety

01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:58.210
of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief.
So when you say it has no impact, it really

01:11:58.210 --> 01:11:59.210
did. It had a very, very big impact.

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:00.210
CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're
going to talk about mayors, that under the

01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:01.210
current mayor, crime has continued to drop,
including murders. So there is...

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:02.210
TRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.

01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:03.210
CLINTON: No, I'm not.

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.210
TRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check
it.

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:05.210
CLINTON: New York -- New York has done an
excellent job. And I give credit -- I give

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:06.210
credit across the board going back two mayors,
two police chiefs, because it has worked.

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:07.210
And other communities need to come together
to do what will work, as well.

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:08.210
Look, one murder is too many. But it is important
that we learn about what has been effective.

01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:09.210
And not go to things that sound good that
really did not have the kind of impact that

01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:10.210
we would want. Who disagrees with keeping
neighborhoods safe?

01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:11.210
But let's also add, 21:57:30 no one should
disagree about respecting the rights of young

01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:12.210
men who live in those neighborhoods. And so
we need to do a better job of working, again,

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:13.210
with the communities, faith communities, business
communities, as well as the police to try

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:14.210
to deal with this problem.

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:15.210
HOLT: This conversation is about race. And
so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:16.210
TRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.

01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:17.210
HOLT: Please -- 20 seconds.

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:18.210
TRUMP: I'd just like to respond.

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:19.210
HOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick
follow-up for you.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.210
TRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American
community has been let down by our politicians.

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:21.210
They talk good around election time, like
right now, and after the election, they said,

01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.210
see ya later, I'll see you in four years.

01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:23.210
The African-American community -- because
-- look, the community within the inner cities

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:24.210
has been so badly treated. They've been abused
and used in order to get votes by Democrat

01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:25.210
politicians, because that's what it is. They've
controlled these communities for up to 100

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.210
years.

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:27.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.210
CLINTON: Well, I -- I do think...

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:30.210
TRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the
inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and

01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.210
I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you
know, you've seen me, I've been all over the

01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:32.210
place. You decided to stay home, and that's
OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over.

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:33.210
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll
ever meet within these communities. And they

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:34.210
are very, very upset with what their politicians
have told them and what their politicians

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:35.210
have done.

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:36.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, I...

01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:37.210
CLINTON: 21:58:53 I think -- I think -- I
think Donald just criticized me for preparing

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:38.210
for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you
know what else I prepared for? I prepared

01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:39.210
to be president. 21:59:06 And I think that's
a good thing.

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:40.210
(APPLAUSE)

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:41.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated
a false claim that the nation's first black

01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:42.210
president was not a natural-born citizen.
You questioned his legitimacy. In the last

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:43.210
couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most
Americans have accepted for years: The president

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:44.210
was born in the United States. Can you tell
us what took you so long?

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:45.210
TRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very
simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for

01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:46.210
the campaign and close -- very close friend
of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager,

01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:47.210
Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign,
her campaign against President Obama, fought

01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:48.210
very hard. And you can go look it up, and
you can check it out.

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:49.210
TRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week,
Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying

01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:50.210
that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy,
highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to

01:12:50.210 --> 01:12:51.210
Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing
it very hard. She failed to get the birth

01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:52.210
certificate.

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:53.210
When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got
him to give the birth certificate. So I'm

01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:54.210
satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm
satisfied with it.

01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:55.210
HOLT: That was...

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:56.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:57.210
TRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating
ISIS, because I want to get on to creating

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.210
jobs, because I want to get on to having a
strong border, because I want to get on to

01:12:58.210 --> 01:12:59.210
things that are very important to me and that
are very important to the country.

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:00.210
HOLT: I will let you respond. It's important.
But I just want to get the answer here. The

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.210
birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've
continued to tell the story and question the

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.210
president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14,
'15...

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:03.210
TRUMP: Yeah.

01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:04.210
HOLT: .... as recently as January. So the
question is, what changed your mind?

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:05.210
TRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody
was caring much about it. I figured you'd

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:06.210
ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody
was caring much about it. But I was the one

01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.210
that got him to produce the birth certificate.
And I think I did a good job.

01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:08.210
Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean,
you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is

01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:09.210
going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's
true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:10.210
just have to take a look at CNN, the last
week, the interview with your former campaign

01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:11.210
manager. And she was involved. But just like
she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.

01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:12.210
HOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow
up -- and I will let you respond to that,

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:13.210
because there's a lot there. But we're talking
about racial healing in this segment. What

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.210
do you say to Americans, people of color who...

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.210
TRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing.
I say nothing, because I was able to get him

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:17.210
to produce it. He should have produced it
a long time before. I say nothing.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:18.210
But let me just tell you. When you talk about
healing, I think that I've developed very,

01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:19.210
very good relationships over the last little
while with the African-American community.

01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:20.210
I think you can see that.

01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:21.210
And I feel that they really wanted me to come
to that conclusion. And I think I did a great

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:22.210
job and a great service not only for the country,
but even for the president, in getting him

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:23.210
to produce his birth certificate.

01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:24.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:25.210
CLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard.

01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:26.210
(LAUGHTER)

01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:27.210
And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew
he was going to stand on this debate stage,

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:28.210
and Lester Holt was going to be asking us
questions, so he tried to put the whole racist

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:29.210
birther lie to bed.

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.210
But it can't be dismissed that easily. He
has really started his political activity

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:31.210
based on this racist lie that our first black
president was not an American citizen. There

01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:32.210
was absolutely no evidence for it, but he
persisted, he persisted year after year, because

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:33.210
some of his supporters, people that he was
trying to bring into his fold, apparently

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:34.210
believed it or wanted to believe it.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:35.210
But, remember, Donald started his career back
in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.210
for racial discrimination because 22:03:18
he would not rent apartments in one of his

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:37.210
developments to African-Americans, and he
made sure that the people who worked for him

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:38.210
understood that was the policy. He actually
was sued twice by the Justice Department.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:39.210
So he has a long record of engaging in racist
behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:40.210
one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great
dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:41.210
him and annoyed him that this was being touted
and used against him.

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.210
But I like to remember what Michelle Obama
said in her amazing speech at our Democratic

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.210
National Convention: When they go low, we
go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:44.210
Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:45.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're
going to move on to the next segment.

01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:46.210
TRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all,
I got to watch in preparing for this some

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:47.210
of your debates against Barack Obama. You
treated him with terrible disrespect. And

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:48.210
I watched the way you talk now about how lovely
everything is and how wonderful you are. It

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:49.210
doesn't work that way. You were after him,
you were trying to -- you even sent out or

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:50.210
your campaign sent out pictures of him in
a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:51.210
think you can deny that.

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.210
But just last week, your campaign manager
said it was true. So when you tried to act

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.210
22:04:42 holier than thou, it really doesn't
work. It really doesn't.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:54.210
Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was
very young, I went into my father's company,

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.210
had a real estate company in Brooklyn and
Queens, and we, along with many, many other

01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:56.210
companies throughout the country -- it was
a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled

01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:57.210
the suit with zero -- with no admission of
guilt. It was very easy to do.

01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:58.210
TRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And,
you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials

01:13:58.210 --> 01:13:59.210
that you do on me in so many different ways,
which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying

01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:00.210
to save the money.

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:01.210
But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and
I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:02.210
that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but
that was a lawsuit brought against many real

01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.210
estate firms, and it's just one of those things.

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:04.210
I'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida,
tough community, a brilliant community, a

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:05.210
wealthy community, probably the wealthiest
community there is in the world, I opened

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:06.210
a club, and really got great credit for it.
No discrimination against African- Americans,

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:07.210
against Muslims, against anybody. And it's
a tremendously successful club. And I'm so

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:08.210
glad I did it. And I have been given great
credit for what I did. And I'm very, very

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.210
proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That
is the true way I feel.

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:10.210
HOLT: Our next segment is called "Securing
America." We want to start with a 21st century

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:11.210
war happening every day in this country. Our
institutions are under cyber attack, and our

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:12.210
secrets are being stolen. So my question is,
who's behind it? And how do we fight it?

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:13.210
Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.

01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:14.210
CLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber
warfare will be one of the biggest challenges

01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:15.210
facing the next president, because clearly
we're facing at this point two different kinds

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:16.210
of adversaries. There are the independent
hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:17.210
reasons to try to steal information that they
can use to make money.

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:18.210
22:06:49 But increasingly, we are seeing cyber
attacks coming from states, organs of states.

01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:19.210
The most recent and troubling of these has
been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia

01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.210
has used cyber attacks against all kinds of
organizations in our country, and I am deeply

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.210
concerned about this. I know Donald's very
praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:22.210
is playing a really...

01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.210
(CROSSTALK)

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:24.210
CLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one
of the things he's done is to let loose cyber

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.210
attackers to hack into government files, to
hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.210
National Committee. And we recently have learned
that, you know, that this is one of their

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:27.210
preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc
and collect information. We need to make it

01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:28.210
very clear -- whether it's Russia, China,
Iran or anybody else -- the United States

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:29.210
has much greater capacity. And we are not
going to sit idly by and permit state actors

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:30.210
to go after our information, our private-sector
information or our public-sector information.

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.210
And we're going to have to make it clear that
we don't want to use the kinds of tools that

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:32.210
we have. We don't want to engage in a different
kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens

01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:33.210
of this country.

01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:34.210
And the Russians need to understand that.
I think they've been treating it as almost

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:35.210
a probing, how far would we go, how much would
we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so

01:14:35.210 --> 01:14:36.210
shocked when Donald publicly 22:08:41 invited
Putin to hack into Americans. That is just

01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:37.210
unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why
50 national security officials who served

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:38.210
in Republican information -- in administrations...

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:39.210
HOLT: Your two minutes have expired.

01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:40.210
CLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit
to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:41.210
like that that really worry people who understand
the threats that we face.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:42.210
HOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and
the same question. Who's behind it? And how

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:43.210
do we fight it?

01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.210
TRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed
-- and more are coming next week -- it will

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.210
be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals
and generals endorsed me to lead this country.

01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:46.210
That just happened, and many more are coming.
And I'm very proud of it.

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:47.210
In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've
never endorsed anybody before on immigration.

01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:48.210
I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently
endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:49.210
So when Secretary Clinton talks about this,
I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:50.210
the generals any day over the political hacks
that I see that have led our country so brilliantly

01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:51.210
over the last 10 years with their knowledge.
OK? Because look at the mess that we're in.

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:52.210
Look at the mess that we're in.

01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:53.210
As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what
Secretary Clinton said. 22:09:52 We should

01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:54.210
be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're
not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia

01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:55.210
that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia,
Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:56.210
I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also
be China. It could also be lots of other people.

01:14:56.210 --> 01:14:57.210
It also could be somebody sitting on their
bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?

01:14:57.210 --> 01:14:58.210
TRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC.

01:14:58.210 --> 01:14:59.210
But what did we learn with DNC? We learned
that 22:10:29 Bernie Sanders was taken advantage

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:00.210
of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders

01:15:00.210 --> 01:15:01.210
was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.210
Now, whether that was Russia, whether that
was China, whether it was another country,

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:03.210
we don't know, because the truth is, under
President Obama we've lost control of things

01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:04.210
that we used to have control over.

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:05.210
We came in with the Internet, we came up with
the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.210
and myself would agree very much, when you
look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet,

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.210
they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.

01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:08.210
So we have to get very, very tough on cyber
and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem.

01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:09.210
I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers.
He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:10.210
The security aspect of cyber is very, very
tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.210
But I will say, we are not doing the job we
should be doing. But that's true throughout

01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:12.210
our whole governmental society. We have so
many things that we have to do better, Lester,

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.210
and certainly cyber is one of them.

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:14.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:15.210
CLINTON: Well, I think there are a number
of issues that we should be addressing. I

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.210
have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does
involve going after them online. I think we

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.210
need to do much more with our tech companies
to prevent ISIS and their operatives from

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:18.210
being able to use the Internet to radicalize,
even direct people in our country and Europe

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:19.210
and elsewhere.

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:20.210
But we also have to intensify our air strikes
against ISIS and eventually support our Arab

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:21.210
and Kurdish partners to be able to actually
take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:22.210
being a Caliphate.

01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.210
We're making progress. Our military is assisting
in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the

01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:24.210
year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq
and then, you know, really squeeze them in

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.210
Syria.

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:26.210
But we have to be cognizant of the fact that
they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer

01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:27.210
for them, foreign money, foreign weapons,
22:12:35 so we have to make this the top priority.

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:28.210
And I would also do everything possible to
take out their leadership. I was involved

01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:29.210
in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida
leadership when I was secretary of state,

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:30.210
including, of course, taking out bin Laden.
And I think we need to go after Baghdadi,

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:31.210
as well, make that one of our organizing principles.
Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:32.210
got to do everything we can to disrupt their
propaganda efforts online.

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:33.210
HOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS
certainly as over there, but there are American

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:34.210
citizens who have been inspired to commit
acts of terror on American soil, the latest

01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:35.210
incident, of course, the bombings we just
saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:36.210
attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last
year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.210
Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell
us specifically how you would prevent homegrown

01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:38.210
attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:39.210
TRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing,
very important. 22:13:32 Secretary Clinton

01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.210
is talking about taking out ISIS. "We will
take out ISIS." Well, President Obama and

01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:41.210
Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way
they got out of Iraq, because they got out

01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:42.210
-- what, they shouldn't have been in, but
once they got in, the way they got out was

01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:43.210
a disaster. And ISIS was formed.

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:44.210
So she talks about taking them out. She's
been doing it a long time. She's been trying

01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:45.210
to take them out for a long time. But they
wouldn't have even been formed if they left

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.210
some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something
more than that. And then you wouldn't have

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:47.210
had them.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.210
Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and
I think you'll agree, because I said it to

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.210
you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should
have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:50.210
been able to form either, because the oil
was their primary source of income. And now

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:51.210
they have the oil all over the place, including
the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which

01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:52.210
was another one of her disasters.

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:53.210
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:15:53.210 --> 01:15:54.210
CLINTON: 22:14:31 Well, I hope the fact-checkers
are turning up the volume and really working

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:55.210
hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.

01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.210
TRUMP: Wrong.

01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:57.210
CLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and
over again.

01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:58.210
TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.

01:15:58.210 --> 01:15:59.210
CLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions
we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be

01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:00.210
taken out, after actually doing some business
with him one time.

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:01.210
CLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says
this constantly -- is George W. Bush made

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:02.210
the agreement about when American troops would
leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:03.210
And the only way that American troops could
have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:04.210
from the then-Iraqi government that would
have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:05.210
would not give that.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:06.210
But let's talk about the question you asked,
Lester. The question you asked is, what do

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:07.210
we do here in the United States? That's the
most important part of this. How do we prevent

01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:08.210
attacks? How do we protect our people?

01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:09.210
And I think we've got to have an intelligence
surge, where we are looking for every scrap

01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:10.210
of information. I was so proud of law enforcement
in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:11.210
You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally
to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:12.210
they brought him down. And we may find out
more information because he is still alive,

01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:13.210
which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:14.210
So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum
up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle

01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:15.210
East. That means we've got to work more closely
with our allies, and that's something that

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.380
Donald has been very dismissive of.

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:24.500
We're working with NATO, the longest military
alliance in the history of the world, to really

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.349
turn our attention to terrorism. We're working
with our friends in the Middle East, many

01:16:29.349 --> 01:16:35.749
of which, as you know, are Muslim majority
nations. Donald has consistently insulted

01:16:35.749 --> 01:16:41.559
Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need
to be cooperating with Muslim nations and

01:16:41.559 --> 01:16:43.249
with the American Muslim community.

01:16:43.249 --> 01:16:49.409
They're on the front lines. They can provide
information to us that we might not get anywhere

01:16:49.409 --> 01:16:55.670
else. They need to have close working cooperation
with law enforcement in these communities,

01:16:55.670 --> 01:17:02.159
not be alienated and pushed away as some of
Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.159
to.

01:17:03.159 --> 01:17:04.159
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:05.159
TRUMP: Well, I have to respond.

01:17:05.159 --> 01:17:10.820
HOLT: Please respond. TRUMP: The secretary
said very strongly about working with -- we've

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:15.340
been working with them for many years, and
we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:19.900
You look at the Middle East, it's a total
mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:23.400
But you look at the Middle East, you started
the Iran deal, that's another beauty where

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:28.039
you have a country that was ready to fall,
I mean, they were doing so badly. They were

01:17:28.039 --> 01:17:32.610
choking on the sanctions. And now they're
going to be actually probably a major power

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:35.070
at some point pretty soon, the way they're
going.

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:40.139
But when you look at NATO, I was asked on
a major show, what do you think of NATO? And

01:17:40.139 --> 01:17:45.079
you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.
I did really well. But I have common sense.

01:17:45.079 --> 01:17:49.850
And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't
given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:54.151
Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many
of them aren't paying their fair share. Number

01:17:54.151 --> 01:17:57.699
two -- and that bothers me, because we should
be asking -- we're defending them, and they

01:17:57.699 --> 01:18:03.840
should at least be paying us what they're
supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.179
And, number two, I said, and very strongly,
NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was

01:18:09.179 --> 01:18:12.880
very strong on this, and it was actually covered
very accurately in the New York Times, which

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:20.090
is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest
-- but I said, they do not focus on terror.

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:23.300
And I was very strong. And I said it numerous
times.

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:27.090
And about four months ago, I read on the front
page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:33.539
is opening up a major terror division. And
I think that's great. And I think we should

01:18:33.539 --> 01:18:39.690
get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent
of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to

01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:44.269
protect other people. But I'm all for NATO.
But I said they have to focus on terror, also.

01:18:44.269 --> 01:18:48.159
And they're going to do that. And that was
-- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to

01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:53.090
get credit for it -- but that was largely
because of what I was saying and my criticism

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:54.090
of NATO.

01:18:54.090 --> 01:19:00.099
I think we have to get NATO to go into the
Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding

01:19:00.099 --> 01:19:05.090
nations, and we have to 22:19:03 knock the
hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast,

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:12.499
when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by
Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe

01:19:12.499 --> 01:19:16.650
me, you were the ones that took out the troops.
Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:19.499
believe it. They sat back probably and said,
I can't believe it. They said...

01:19:19.499 --> 01:19:20.499
CLINTON: Lester, we've covered...

01:19:20.499 --> 01:19:21.499
TRUMP: No, wait a minute.

01:19:21.499 --> 01:19:22.499
CLINTON: We've covered this ground.

01:19:22.499 --> 01:19:25.499
TRUMP: When they formed, when they formed,
this is something that never should have happened.

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:30.150
It should have never happened. Now, you're
talking about taking out ISIS. But you were

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:35.909
there, and you were secretary of state when
it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30

01:19:35.909 --> 01:19:38.679
countries. And you're going to stop them?
I don't think so.

01:19:38.679 --> 01:19:43.439
HOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment
questions. You had supported the war in Iraq

01:19:43.439 --> 01:19:46.190
before the invasion. What makes your...

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.610
TRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:48.610
HOLT: In 2002...

01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:54.070
TRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense
put out by her, because she -- frankly, I

01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:57.110
think the best person in her campaign is mainstream
media.

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:58.422
HOLT: My question is, since you supported
it...

01:19:58.422 --> 01:19:59.422
TRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear...

01:19:59.422 --> 01:20:00.749
HOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment...

01:20:00.749 --> 01:20:05.070
TRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war
in Iraq. Just so you put it out.

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:06.699
HOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why
-- why was...

01:20:06.699 --> 01:20:07.699
TRUMP: The record does not show that.

01:20:07.699 --> 01:20:08.699
HOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any...

01:20:08.699 --> 01:20:13.600
TRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When
I did an interview with Howard Stern, very

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.239
lightly, first time anyone's asked me that,
I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe,

01:20:18.239 --> 01:20:24.880
who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview
with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.570
is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity,
which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.

01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:36.789
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity
at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called

01:20:36.789 --> 01:20:41.389
me the other day -- and I spoke to him about
it -- he said you were totally against the

01:20:41.389 --> 01:20:42.389
war, because he was for the war.

01:20:42.389 --> 01:20:43.790
HOLT: Why is your judgment better than...

01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:47.269
TRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that
was before the war started. Sean Hannity said

01:20:47.269 --> 01:20:51.690
very strongly to me and other people -- he's
willing to say it, but nobody wants to call

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:55.980
him. I was against the war. He said, you used
to have fights with me, because Sean was in

01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.480
favor of the war.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.719
And I understand that side, also, not very
much, because we should have never been there.

01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:07.420
But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they
did an article in a major magazine, shortly

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:14.389
after the war started. I think in '04. But
they did an article which had me totally against

01:21:14.389 --> 01:21:16.179
the war in Iraq.

01:21:16.179 --> 01:21:21.180
And one of your compatriots said, you know,
whether it was before or right after, Trump

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.820
was definitely -- because if you read this
article, there's no doubt. But if somebody

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:29.869
-- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would
call up Sean Hannity, this was before the

01:21:29.869 --> 01:21:34.889
war started. He and I used to have arguments
about the war. I said, it's a terrible and

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:39.949
a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize
the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's

01:21:39.949 --> 01:21:40.949
done. It's been a disaster.

01:21:40.949 --> 01:21:43.689
HOLT: My reference was to what you had said
in 2002, and my question was...

01:21:43.689 --> 01:21:44.689
TRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said.

01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:46.889
HOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your
judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's

01:21:46.889 --> 01:21:47.889
judgment?

01:21:47.889 --> 01:21:51.179
TRUMP: 22:21:48 Well, I have much better judgment
than she does. There's no question about that.

01:21:51.179 --> 01:21:54.840
I also have a much better temperament than
she has, you know?

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840
(LAUGHTER)

01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:00.449
I have a much better -- she spent -- let me
tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:05.849
of dollars on an advertising -- you know,
they get Madison Avenue into a room, they

01:22:05.849 --> 01:22:10.530
put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after
-- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far,

01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:16.030
is my temperament. I have a winning temperament.
I know how to win. She does not have a...

01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:17.030
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:22.130
TRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind
the blue screen, I don't know who you were

01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:27.849
talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were
totally out of control. I said, there's a

01:22:27.849 --> 01:22:30.519
person with a temperament that's got a problem.

01:22:30.519 --> 01:22:32.840
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.179
CLINTON: Whew, OK.

01:22:37.179 --> 01:22:38.630
(LAUGHTER)

01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:45.119
Let's talk about two important issues that
were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.

01:22:45.119 --> 01:22:50.269
You know, NATO as a military alliance has
something called Article 5, and basically

01:22:50.269 --> 01:22:56.429
it says this: An attack on one is an attack
on all. And you know the only time it's ever

01:22:56.429 --> 01:23:05.189
been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations
of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:13.019
with us to fight terrorism, something that
they still are doing by our side.

01:23:13.019 --> 01:23:18.909
With respect to Iran, when I became secretary
of state, Iran was weeks away from having

01:23:18.909 --> 01:23:25.280
enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They
had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:31.030
the Bush administration. They had built covert
facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges

01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:33.139
that were whirling away.

01:23:33.139 --> 01:23:38.889
And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every
sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate,

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:45.030
but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half
putting together a coalition that included

01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:50.739
Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions
on Iran.

01:23:50.739 --> 01:23:57.419
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.
And my successor, John Kerry, and President

01:23:57.419 --> 01:24:05.190
Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's
nuclear program without firing a single shot.

01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:10.019
That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building.
That's working with other nations.

01:24:10.019 --> 01:24:16.780
The other day, I saw Donald saying that there
were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:23.110
waters off of Iran, and they were taunting
American sailors who were on a nearby ship.

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:28.649
He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors,
22:24:28 I'd blow them out of the water and

01:24:28.649 --> 01:24:30.800
start another war. That's not good judgment.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.499
TRUMP: That would not start a war.

01:24:32.499 --> 01:24:39.099
CLINTON: That is not the right temperament
to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.

01:24:39.099 --> 01:24:40.989
And the worst part...

01:24:40.989 --> 01:24:41.989
TRUMP: No, they were taunting us.

01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:46.789
CLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has
been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly

01:24:46.789 --> 01:24:52.699
that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear
weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.

01:24:52.699 --> 01:24:57.800
It has been the policy of the United States,
Democrats and Republicans, to do everything

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.760
we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear
weapons. He even said, well, you know, if

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.780
there were nuclear war in East Asia, well,
you know, that's fine...

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.780
TRUMP: Wrong.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:10.809
CLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.

01:25:10.809 --> 01:25:11.809
TRUMP: It's lies.

01:25:11.809 --> 01:25:17.599
CLINTON: And, in fact, his 22:25:17 cavalier
attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply

01:25:17.599 --> 01:25:24.469
troubling. That is the number-one threat we
face in the world. And it becomes particularly

01:25:24.469 --> 01:25:29.900
threatening if terrorists ever get their hands
on any nuclear material. So a man who can

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:35.240
be provoked by a tweet should not have his
fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.610
far as I think anyone with any sense about
this should be concerned.

01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:41.880
TRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old,
I must say. I would like to...

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.459
CLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well
describes the problem.

01:25:44.459 --> 01:25:45.459
(LAUGHTER)

01:25:45.459 --> 01:25:49.249
TRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's
not an accurate one. So I just want to give

01:25:49.249 --> 01:25:54.760
a lot of things -- and just to respond. I
agree with her on one thing. The single greatest

01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:02.039
problem the world has is nuclear armament,
nuclear weapons, 22:26:04 not global warming,

01:26:02.039 --> 01:26:06.249
like you think and your -- your president
thinks.

01:26:06.249 --> 01:26:12.949
Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just
to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend

01:26:12.949 --> 01:26:17.330
Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend
Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do

01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:22.889
not pay us. But they should be paying us,
because we are providing tremendous service

01:26:22.889 --> 01:26:27.159
and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're
losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.

01:26:27.159 --> 01:26:33.449
I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.
All I said, that it's very possible that if

01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:37.679
they don't pay a fair share, because this
isn't 40 years ago where we could do what

01:26:37.679 --> 01:26:43.070
we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth,
selling us cars by the million...

01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:44.150
HOLT: We need to move on.

01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:48.249
TRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important.
All I said was, they may have to defend themselves

01:26:48.249 --> 01:26:53.790
or they have to help us out. We're a country
that owes $20 trillion. They have to help

01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:54.790
us out.

01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:55.790
HOLT: Our last...

01:26:55.790 --> 01:27:01.199
TRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned,
I agree. It is the single greatest threat

01:27:01.199 --> 01:27:02.199
that this country has.

01:27:02.199 --> 01:27:05.189
HOLT: Which leads to my next question, as
we enter our last segment here (inaudible)

01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:10.219
the subject of securing America. On nuclear
weapons, President Obama reportedly considered

01:27:10.219 --> 01:27:15.809
changing the nation's longstanding policy
on first use. Do you support the current policy?

01:27:15.809 --> 01:27:16.959
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.

01:27:16.959 --> 01:27:21.369
TRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know,
for what Secretary Clinton was saying about

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:27.010
nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in
the way she talks about various countries.

01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:32.699
But Russia has been expanding their -- they
have a much newer capability than we do. We

01:27:32.699 --> 01:27:35.969
have not been updating from the new standpoint.

01:27:35.969 --> 01:27:40.570
I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s,
they're old enough that your father, your

01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:45.739
grandfather could be flying them. We are not
-- we are not keeping up with other countries.

01:27:45.739 --> 01:27:51.070
I would like everybody to end it, just get
rid of it. But I would certainly not do first

01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:52.070
strike.

01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:58.679
I think that once the nuclear alternative
happens, it's over. At the same time, we have

01:27:58.679 --> 01:28:02.750
to be prepared. I can't take anything off
the table. Because you look at some of these

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:07.610
countries, you look at North Korea, we're
doing nothing there. China should solve that

01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:14.110
problem for us. 22:28:09 China should go into
North Korea. China is totally powerful as

01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:16.010
it relates to North Korea.

01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:19.340
And by the way, another one powerful is the
worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:23.821
that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is
one of their biggest trading partners. Iran

01:28:23.821 --> 01:28:26.169
has power over North Korea.

01:28:26.169 --> 01:28:32.070
And when they made that horrible deal with
Iran, they should have included the fact that

01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:37.050
they do something with respect to North Korea.
And they should have done something with respect

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:39.479
to Yemen and all these other places.

01:28:39.479 --> 01:28:44.719
And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't
you do that? Why didn't you add other things

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:51.360
into the deal? One of the great giveaways
of all time, of all time, including $400 million

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:57.639
in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That
turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7

01:28:57.639 --> 01:29:04.969
billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the
hostages. It certainly looks that way.

01:29:04.969 --> 01:29:11.090
So you say to yourself, why didn't they make
the right deal? This is one of the worst deals

01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:18.929
ever made by any country in history. The deal
with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All

01:29:18.929 --> 01:29:21.469
they have to do is sit back 10 years, and
they don't have to do much.

01:29:21.469 --> 01:29:22.469
HOLT: Your two minutes is expired.

01:29:22.469 --> 01:29:25.889
TRUMP: And they're going to end up getting
nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other

01:29:25.889 --> 01:29:28.130
day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:30.979
HOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton,
you have two minutes.

01:29:30.979 --> 01:29:35.849
CLINTON: 22:29:30 Well, let me -- let me start
by saying, words matter. Words matter when

01:29:35.849 --> 01:29:42.659
you run for president. And they really matter
when you are president. And I want to reassure

01:29:42.659 --> 01:29:49.699
our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere
that we have mutual defense treaties and we

01:29:49.699 --> 01:29:51.800
will honor them.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:58.689
It is essential that America's word be good.
And so I know that this campaign has caused

01:29:58.689 --> 01:30:05.030
some questioning and worries on the part of
many leaders across the globe. I've talked

01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:11.989
with a number of them. But I want to -- on
behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of

01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:17.340
a majority of the American people, say that,
you know, our word is good.

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:25.730
It's also important that we look at the entire
global situation. There's no doubt that we

01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:31.019
have other problems with Iran. But personally,
I'd rather deal with the other problems having

01:30:31.019 --> 01:30:36.039
put that lid on their nuclear program than
still to be facing that.

01:30:36.039 --> 01:30:40.249
And Donald never tells you what he would do.
Would he have started a war? Would he have

01:30:40.249 --> 01:30:47.289
bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a
deal that has been very successful in giving

01:30:47.289 --> 01:30:53.999
us access to Iranian facilities that we never
had before, then he should tell us what his

01:30:53.999 --> 01:30:59.999
alternative would be. But it's like his plan
to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan,

01:30:59.999 --> 01:31:03.110
but the only secret is that he has no plan.

01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:08.030
22:31:04 So we need to be more precise in
how we talk about these issues. People around

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:15.150
the word follow our presidential campaigns
so closely, trying to get hints about what

01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:22.320
we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going
to lead the world with strength and in accordance

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:28.790
with our values? That's what I intend to do.
I intend to be a leader of our country that

01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:34.400
people can count on, both here at home and
around the world, to make decisions that will

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:40.380
further peace and prosperity, but also stand
up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:41.380
home.

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:48.749
We cannot let those who would try to destabilize
the world to interfere with American interests

01:31:48.749 --> 01:31:49.749
and security...

01:31:49.749 --> 01:31:50.749
HOLT: Your two minutes is...

01:31:50.749 --> 01:31:52.580
CLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities
at all.

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:53.580
HOLT: ... is expired.

01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:54.599
TRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say.

01:31:54.599 --> 01:31:55.760
HOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.199
TRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will
tell you that Hillary will tell you to go

01:32:00.199 --> 01:32:05.010
to her website and read all about how to defeat
ISIS, which she could have defeated by never

01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:08.590
having it, you know, get going in the first
place. Right now, it's getting tougher and

01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:12.760
tougher to defeat them, because they're in
more and more places, more and more states,

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.760
more and more nations.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.489
TRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far
as Japan is concerned, I want to help all

01:32:18.489 --> 01:32:26.239
of our allies, but we are losing billions
and billions of dollars. We cannot be the

01:32:26.239 --> 01:32:31.199
policemen of the world. We cannot protect
countries all over the world...

01:32:31.199 --> 01:32:32.199
HOLT: We have just...

01:32:32.199 --> 01:32:33.459
TRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what
we need.

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:34.869
HOLT: We have just a few final questions...

01:32:34.869 --> 01:32:38.349
TRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's
got no business ability. We need heart. We

01:32:38.349 --> 01:32:43.369
need a lot of things. But you have to have
some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't

01:32:43.369 --> 01:32:47.360
have that. All of the things that she's talking
about could have been taken care of during

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:52.579
the last 10 years, let's say, while she had
great power. But they weren't taken care of.

01:32:52.579 --> 01:32:55.399
And if she ever wins this race, they won't
be taken care of.

01:32:55.399 --> 01:32:58.079
HOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton
became the 22:32:57 first woman nominated

01:32:58.079 --> 01:33:02.780
for president by a major party. Earlier this
month, you said she doesn't have, quote, "a

01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:06.820
presidential look." She's standing here right
now. What did you mean by that?

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:11.639
TRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't
have the stamina. I said she doesn't have

01:33:11.639 --> 01:33:17.349
the stamina. And I don't believe she does
have the stamina. To be president of this

01:33:17.349 --> 01:33:19.449
country, you need tremendous stamina.

01:33:19.449 --> 01:33:20.449
HOLT: The quote was, "I just don't think she
has the presidential look."

01:33:20.449 --> 01:33:24.679
TRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute,
Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask

01:33:24.679 --> 01:33:25.679
me a question?

01:33:25.679 --> 01:33:31.800
You have to be able to negotiate our trade
deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:38.119
right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean,
can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?

01:33:38.119 --> 01:33:41.650
And with all of the money they have, we're
defending them, and they're not paying? All

01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:46.269
you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You
have so many different things you have to

01:33:46.269 --> 01:33:50.179
be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary
has the stamina.

01:33:50.179 --> 01:33:51.969
HOLT: Let's let her respond.

01:33:51.969 --> 01:33:59.869
CLINTON: 22:33:52 Well, as soon as he travels
to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal,

01:33:59.869 --> 01:34:07.439
a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an
opening of new opportunities in nations around

01:34:07.439 --> 01:34:13.050
the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying
in front of a congressional committee, he

01:34:13.050 --> 01:34:14.510
can talk to me about stamina.

01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:15.510
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:22.840
TRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me
tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.981
bad experience. We have made so many bad deals
during the last -- so she's got experience,

01:34:27.981 --> 01:34:28.981
that I agree.

01:34:28.981 --> 01:34:29.981
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:29.981 --> 01:34:34.360
But it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's
the Iran deal that you're so in love with,

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:41.519
where we gave them $150 billion back, whether
it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything

01:34:41.519 --> 01:34:46.729
you can -- name -- you almost can't name a
good deal. I agree. She's got experience,

01:34:46.729 --> 01:34:51.019
but it's bad experience. And this country
can't afford to have another four years of

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:52.329
that kind of experience.

01:34:52.329 --> 01:34:55.709
HOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question.

01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:56.709
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:57.709
CLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.

01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:58.709
HOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final
question now.

01:34:58.709 --> 01:35:04.360
CLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from
looks to stamina. But this is a man who has

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:13.269
called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone
who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience

01:35:13.269 --> 01:35:14.629
to employers, who has said...

01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:15.919
TRUMP: I never said that.

01:35:15.919 --> 01:35:19.889
CLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay
unless they do as good a job as men.

01:35:19.889 --> 01:35:21.019
TRUMP: I didn't say that.

01:35:21.019 --> 01:35:28.060
CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said
was about a woman in a beauty contest. He

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:34.169
loves beauty contests, supporting them and
hanging around them. And he called this woman

01:35:34.169 --> 01:35:40.709
22:35:35 "Miss Piggy." Then he called her
"Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina.

01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:41.959
Donald, she has a name.

01:35:41.959 --> 01:35:43.730
TRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did
you find this?

01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:44.730
CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.

01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:45.730
TRUMP: Where did you find this?

01:35:45.730 --> 01:35:48.610
CLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen,
and you can bet...

01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:50.469
TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going
to vote this November.

01:35:50.469 --> 01:35:51.849
TRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...

01:35:51.849 --> 01:35:52.849
(APPLAUSE)

01:35:52.849 --> 01:35:55.090
HOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds
and then we ask the final question...

01:35:55.090 --> 01:36:00.219
TRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with
tremendous commercials. Some of it's said

01:36:00.219 --> 01:36:05.210
in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody
who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell,

01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:09.329
I said very tough things to her, and I think
everybody would agree that she deserves it

01:36:09.329 --> 01:36:11.149
and nobody feels sorry for her.

01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:14.189
But you want to know the truth? I was going
to say something...

01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:16.639
HOLT: Please very quickly.

01:36:16.639 --> 01:36:23.070
TRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to
her family, and I said to myself, "I can't

01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:29.199
do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate.
It's not nice." But she spent hundreds of

01:36:29.199 --> 01:36:34.749
millions of dollars on negative ads on me,
many of which are absolutely untrue. They're

01:36:34.749 --> 01:36:37.419
untrue. And they're misrepresentations.

01:36:37.419 --> 01:36:42.820
And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not
nice. And I don't deserve that.

01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:47.429
22:36:42 But it's certainly not a nice thing
that she's done. It's hundreds of millions

01:36:47.429 --> 01:36:52.519
of ads. And the only gratifying thing is,
I saw the polls come in today, and with all

01:36:52.519 --> 01:36:53.519
of that money...

01:36:53.519 --> 01:36:54.519
HOLT: We have to move on to the final question.

01:36:54.519 --> 01:36:58.919
TRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm
either winning or tied, and I've spent practically

01:36:58.919 --> 01:36:59.919
nothing.

01:36:59.919 --> 01:37:00.919
(APPLAUSE)

01:37:00.919 --> 01:37:04.480
HOLT: One of you will not win this election.
So my final question to you tonight, are you

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:08.439
willing to accept the outcome as the will
of the voters? Secretary Clinton?

01:37:08.439 --> 01:37:14.809
CLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But

01:37:14.809 --> 01:37:20.249
I certainly will support the outcome of this
election.

01:37:20.249 --> 01:37:24.780
And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant
doubts about it, but I hope the people out

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:30.579
there understand: This election's really up
to you. It's not about us so much as it is

01:37:30.579 --> 01:37:35.599
about you and your families and the kind of
country and future you want. So I sure hope

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:40.719
you will get out and vote as though your future
depended on it, because I think it does.

01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:43.969
HOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question.
Will you accept the outcome as the will of

01:37:43.969 --> 01:37:49.710
the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America
great again. We are a nation that is seriously

01:37:49.710 --> 01:37:53.760
troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are
pouring into our country.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.229
The other day, we were deporting 800 people.
And perhaps they passed the wrong button,

01:37:59.229 --> 01:38:03.689
they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps
worse than that, it was corruption, but these

01:38:03.689 --> 01:38:09.479
people that we were going to deport for good
reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up

01:38:09.479 --> 01:38:14.849
becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now
it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't

01:38:14.849 --> 01:38:15.849
even know.

01:38:15.849 --> 01:38:16.849
HOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?

01:38:16.849 --> 01:38:20.270
TRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make
America great again. I'm going to be able

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:24.750
to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The
answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely

01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:25.750
support her.

01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:26.750
(APPLAUSE)

01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:29.879
HOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do
it for us. That concludes our debate for this

01:38:29.879 --> 01:38:33.729
evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of
ground, 22:38:33 not everything as I suspected

01:38:33.729 --> 01:38:35.360
we would.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.730
The next presidential debates are scheduled
for October 9th at Washington University in

01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:45.510
St. Louis and October 19th at the University
of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will

01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:46.510
continue.

01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:50.610
A reminder. The vice presidential debate is
scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University

01:38:50.610 --> 01:38:56.099
in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary
Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra

01:38:56.099 --> 01:39:00.409
University for hosting us tonight. Good night,
everyone. 22:38:58

01:39:00.409 --> 01:39:06.019
GWEN IFILL: And that concludes the first debate
between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

01:39:06.019 --> 01:39:07.550
We watched them there on the stage.

01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:13.460
Joining Gwen Ifill and me here in our studio
for some analysis, syndicated columnist Mark

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:19.179
Shields, New York Times columnist David Brooks,
and Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report.

01:39:19.179 --> 01:39:24.949
Mark Shields, they did cover a lot of ground,
from jobs to taxes, from race to ISIS, and

01:39:24.949 --> 01:39:29.189
just now women. What did you make of it all?

01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:35.199
MARK SHIELDS: I think that, first of all,
Donald Trump made it about him, rather than

01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:36.880
about the American people.

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:45.869
I think that was missing in his message. And
I really think that he is remarkable political

01:39:45.869 --> 01:39:50.189
figure, in that, if you think about American
presidents, whether it's Ronald Reagan or

01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:55.909
John Kennedy or Barack Obama or Franklin Roosevelt,
there was always an optimism to them.

01:39:55.909 --> 01:40:01.780
That is a very dark and rather dreary message,
that we're surrounded by people who are not

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:08.179
simply incompetent, but who are cutting deals,
who have conflicts of interest.

01:40:08.179 --> 01:40:14.239
If -- Hillary Clinton, I thought was Hillary
Clinton. She was factual. She was well-organized

01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:19.300
in her thinking, not particularly likable,
did not come across as -- did not reveal much

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:24.619
about herself, other that anecdote about her
dad again and the nod to the grandchild at

01:40:24.619 --> 01:40:26.149
the opening.

01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:30.889
I really thought Trump did -- failed his test
of presidential...

01:40:30.889 --> 01:40:34.739
GWEN IFILL: And as we watch the families come
on stage, as is typical after these debates,

01:40:34.739 --> 01:40:40.030
the Clintons, former President Bill Clinton
and Hillary Clinton, of course. And Chelsea

01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:41.209
Clinton is there as well.

01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:44.760
And on the other half of the stage, Melania
and Donald Trump, his sons, his daughters,

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.760
others.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.719
Now, Amy, we -- I counted -- we counted it
up. Hillary Clinton referred to Donald Trump

01:40:51.719 --> 01:40:57.219
by his first name, Donald -- most people call
him Mr. Trump -- 22 times. She clearly had

01:40:57.219 --> 01:41:00.900
it in her mind that she wanted to get under
his skin, to bug him. Did it work?

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:05.449
AMY WALTER: Well, he was on the defensive
much more than he was on the offense in this

01:41:05.449 --> 01:41:10.230
debate, whether it was on question of the
birtherism, on his taxes, his support for

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:16.389
the Iraq War, the debate about women, and
his things he said about women, about stamina.

01:41:16.389 --> 01:41:23.300
This was a debate in which she was able -- and
I think that Mark is completely right. Trump

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:27.320
made it about himself, but she helped him
to make it about himself.

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:34.059
Look, she didn't provide the vision. I think
that there are a lot of folks, even on the

01:41:34.059 --> 01:41:39.690
Democratic side, looking for that sense of,
what is the bigger message of Hillary Clinton?

01:41:39.690 --> 01:41:46.800
She's very smart. She has all of the facts
outlined. She has all the policy papers up

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.800
on her Web site.

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:54.419
But the bigger, sort of cohesive vision for
where we take America, I just -- I don't know

01:41:54.419 --> 01:41:56.889
that we still saw that in this debate.

01:41:56.889 --> 01:42:00.489
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how do you see this?
Did either one of them do what they needed

01:42:00.489 --> 01:42:01.489
to do tonight?

01:42:01.489 --> 01:42:04.800
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it wasn't -- if what they
needed to do was make me feel better about

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.610
the country, they failed. It was the opposite
of elevating on both sides.

01:42:08.610 --> 01:42:12.559
I thought, for the first half-hour, that Donald
Trump was winning. And I thought that was

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:18.079
because, he may be obnoxious, but he is a
change agent. And the first half-hour was

01:42:18.079 --> 01:42:19.389
on his turf.

01:42:19.389 --> 01:42:22.860
And her answers, Hillary Clinton's answers,
went it was on -- gets to policy, it can't

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:26.820
just be three things. It has to be 16 things.
And you get in laundry list mode.

01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:30.780
Then she started attacking him. And she had
two devastatingly good answers, on the birther

01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:34.820
issue and the tax return issue, which were
really good assaults on him. So, even though

01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:38.159
she's not good at describing a policy, she's
really good at going after him.

01:42:38.159 --> 01:42:43.219
And then the debate got on, and Donald Trump
became Donald Trump. And with every answer,

01:42:43.219 --> 01:42:47.709
it was digging it a little deeper. His birther
answer was abysmal, and bunch of bad answers

01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:53.019
all in a row. The race issue was terrible,
the looks issue, bad.

01:42:53.019 --> 01:42:56.789
And so he just -- at his lack of preparation,
and, frankly, a lot of his policies and his

01:42:56.789 --> 01:43:00.829
character just got worse and worse and worse.
So, I think you would have to say this was

01:43:00.829 --> 01:43:01.829
a Clinton night.

01:43:01.829 --> 01:43:06.709
GWEN IFILL: John Yang is in -- at Hofstra
University for us tonight. He's at the site

01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:08.059
of tonight's debate.

01:43:08.059 --> 01:43:11.379
And I'm wondering what the scene is like there,
John, how it's going over.

01:43:11.379 --> 01:43:16.840
JOHN YANG: Well, I tell you, the spinners
are just coming out. I'm just in front of

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.539
the Donald Trump holding room.

01:43:19.539 --> 01:43:26.579
You can see them coming by here. Before, Senator
Claire McCaskill came by. She's obviously

01:43:26.579 --> 01:43:31.630
a supporter of Secretary Clinton. She was
telling me that she felt -- and this is sort

01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:36.840
of the line coming out of their -- the Clinton
room tonight -- that Donald Trump, once again,

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.340
they say, showed that he wasn't prepared to
be president.

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:44.959
They say that this was -- they say that it
came right from the top, when the secretary

01:43:44.959 --> 01:43:52.129
was able to give what they say -- what they're
saying was a coherent policy about providing

01:43:52.129 --> 01:43:54.519
jobs in America. But he wasn't.

01:43:54.519 --> 01:44:00.860
I tried to -- Governor Christie went by, wouldn't
stop. I'm trying to see if I can get someone

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:04.510
from the Trump campaign to get their reaction.

01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:07.209
But, so far, that's what we have gotten so
far.

01:44:07.209 --> 01:44:10.590
GWEN IFILL: OK, John, we're going to let you
keep searching for people in the room to talk

01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:11.909
to. And we will get back to you.

01:44:11.909 --> 01:44:16.769
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, I want to come to
you, because was there any -- David was saying

01:44:16.769 --> 01:44:20.189
that Donald Trump did better in the first
half-hour, when they talked about jobs, and

01:44:20.189 --> 01:44:25.010
he talked about jobs leaving the country.
Did Hillary Clinton ever have an answer to

01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:26.010
that?

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:29.030
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I thought -- I mean, she
was defensive. There's no question about it.

01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:30.860
She was defensive on the TPP.

01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:35.340
But her answer that there were more manufacturing
jobs -- she did the defense of her husband's

01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:40.439
economic record, not a very -- a rather tepid
defense. There was a hell of a defense to

01:44:40.439 --> 01:44:45.289
be made for Bill Clinton's eight years of
22 million jobs and the lowest unemployment

01:44:45.289 --> 01:44:48.349
rates for African-Americans in the history
of the country, balancing the budget.

01:44:48.349 --> 01:44:52.519
She did -- she just said more manufacturing
jobs in the '90s.

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:56.820
But I want to say, in defense of Trump, and
not to be totally -- I have never heard a

01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.729
presidential candidate -- and I have heard
40 of them -- say, I'm extremely underleveraged.

01:45:00.729 --> 01:45:01.729
(LAUGHTER)

01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:05.879
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, that was a rather remarkable
statement, if you think about it.

01:45:05.879 --> 01:45:11.289
And when he talked about not paying taxes,
he said, it would be squandered, too. That's

01:45:11.289 --> 01:45:18.429
why he didn't pay any taxes. And I thought
those were -- the explanation, the one that

01:45:18.429 --> 01:45:22.449
will be most memorable, was that, who hacked
the DNC? It wasn't Russia. Could have been

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:25.369
Russia. Could have been China. Could have
been some other country, or it could have

01:45:25.369 --> 01:45:28.110
been someone sitting on the bed that weighs
400 pounds.

01:45:28.110 --> 01:45:30.479
I don't know if the bed weighs 400 pounds
or the person weighs 400 pounds.

01:45:30.479 --> 01:45:31.479
(LAUGHTER)

01:45:31.479 --> 01:45:33.940
GWEN IFILL: And that is your definition of
"in defense of Donald Trump"?

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.550
MARK SHIELDS: That was it. That was it.

01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:36.550
GWEN IFILL: Just checking.

01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:37.550
DAVID BROOKS: He touched me. I'm underleveraged
myself.

01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:38.550
(CROSSTALK)

01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:39.550
(LAUGHTER)

01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:42.159
GWEN IFILL: Can we talk a little bit about
the line of questioning on race?

01:45:42.159 --> 01:45:47.449
Because when -- I never heard presidential
candidate in the debate call the person that

01:45:47.449 --> 01:45:52.169
he or she is running against, use the word
racist, three times. And also, when he was

01:45:52.169 --> 01:45:55.880
asked about race, Donald Trump talked about
law and order.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:59.250
What were the dog whistles in the room? Or
maybe they weren't even dog whistles. Everybody

01:45:59.250 --> 01:46:00.250
could hear them.

01:46:00.250 --> 01:46:01.250
AMY WALTER: Yes.

01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:06.860
Donald Trump's answer, whenever there's an
issue on -- whether it's on race, whether

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:11.059
it's on policing, whether it's on terrorism,
he always comes back to, it's all about law

01:46:11.059 --> 01:46:13.899
and order. We're going to get the police.
We're going to get stuff done, because that's

01:46:13.899 --> 01:46:15.530
how things work.

01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:22.360
And we also know that that is an answer that
is not a comfortable answer for many people

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:29.230
in the African-American community and in -- among
nonwhite voters, about who gets profiled when

01:46:29.230 --> 01:46:34.760
we have stop and frisk programs, when we have
law and order, what that actually means.

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:40.869
These were questions that were not the kinds
of questions that Donald Trump answers particularly

01:46:40.869 --> 01:46:45.340
well. But that's not who he's playing to.
We talked about this a lot during the convention.

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:49.719
Throughout this -- throughout the convention,
throughout this debate, Donald Trump talked

01:46:49.719 --> 01:46:53.879
to the same people he's been talking to this
entire campaign. There are a group of voters

01:46:53.879 --> 01:47:01.079
out there who are white, who are working class
who he's done very, very well with. And those

01:47:01.079 --> 01:47:04.939
are voters he expects to take him all the
way throughout this election.

01:47:04.939 --> 01:47:08.480
And he's not interested in reaching out and
getting beyond that base.

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:11.729
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, David, picking up
what Amy is saying, it seems to me that much

01:47:11.729 --> 01:47:15.710
of this debate was on territory where Donald
Trump is uncomfortable, I mean, the whole

01:47:15.710 --> 01:47:20.579
birther question. Lester Holt raised that.
He pushed Donald Trump on that. He pushed

01:47:20.579 --> 01:47:24.110
him on his tax returns, which we have been
talking about.

01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:27.349
These were areas where Donald Trump was back
against the ropes.

01:47:27.349 --> 01:47:28.349
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

01:47:28.349 --> 01:47:31.699
I do think Holt was tougher on Trump than
on Clinton. Maybe there's more to work with

01:47:31.699 --> 01:47:36.340
there. And he certainly exposed some vulnerabilities.
The defense that "I have a country club in

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:40.769
Palm Beach which allows in minorities," that's
not -- that is not your good defense.

01:47:40.769 --> 01:47:41.769
But...

01:47:41.769 --> 01:47:45.690
GWEN IFILL: Trump is apparently already tweeting
that there weren't good questions about e-mails,

01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:46.690
about Benghazi...

01:47:46.690 --> 01:47:47.690
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

01:47:47.690 --> 01:47:48.690
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the Clinton Foundation.

01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:49.690
DAVID BROOKS: And somewhat fair, actually.

01:47:49.690 --> 01:47:52.520
But here is way think it's going to happen.
I think he really looked bad on some of the

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.520
-- especially some of the racial stuff, on
the gender stuff, a lot of stuff.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:02.610
And so I think we can expect his polls to
drop as after the convention season. But,

01:48:02.610 --> 01:48:07.699
as Amy said, that's not his audience. And,
two, he is thematically so consistent. We

01:48:07.699 --> 01:48:10.969
are under assault, we're under assault, we're
under assault.

01:48:10.969 --> 01:48:16.320
And it wouldn't surprise me if he then -- his
numbers then began to go up, as they have

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.039
in the last couple weeks, with all this stuff.
He's already said all this before.

01:48:19.039 --> 01:48:22.249
GWEN IFILL: I might also add that, if you
want to know, we have been keeping track of

01:48:22.249 --> 01:48:25.519
the things that were true, the things that
were false that were said tonight on our Web

01:48:25.519 --> 01:48:30.250
site, PBS.org/NewsHour. Just go there and
find what all of our experts, including our

01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:33.809
own -- well, Margaret Warner, our own Paul
Solman are telling -- answering these questions.

01:48:33.809 --> 01:48:34.809
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pulling it together.

01:48:34.809 --> 01:48:39.820
GWEN IFILL: But facts -- facts seemed to be
an important issue here than -- or lack thereof,

01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:43.899
tonight, Mark. And that was also Hillary Clinton's
turf.

01:48:43.899 --> 01:48:46.659
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. No, that's where she is.

01:48:46.659 --> 01:48:53.679
But she can't give a short answer. That is
a real problem. There is a little bit of,

01:48:53.679 --> 01:48:59.739
let me tell you how much I know. And I -- I
don't even know the capital of Sweden, but

01:48:59.739 --> 01:49:04.899
I can tell you what the principal products
of Sweden are and how long, you know, Stockholm

01:49:04.899 --> 01:49:12.379
-- and I think that is -- but I have -- again,
there are moments in the debate which I think

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:13.379
we can't ignore.

01:49:13.379 --> 01:49:18.280
And that is, "You don't learn a lot from the
tax returns, that, I can tell you," explaining

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:23.679
why he hasn't released his own taxes, and
said paying no federal taxes makes me smart.

01:49:23.679 --> 01:49:29.929
Now, I'm sorry. I mean, the cops and E-4s
in the Marine Corps and schoolteachers and

01:49:29.929 --> 01:49:36.479
registered nurses who pay taxes every year,
I don't know if not paying taxes for the two

01:49:36.479 --> 01:49:40.070
years that he has on the record is a recommendation.

01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:41.070
(CROSSTALK)

01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:45.070
DAVID BROOKS: I would agree with you, if the
Republican debates hadn't happened.

01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:48.039
And maybe it's just the Republican audiences
are different. But the rules are a little

01:49:48.039 --> 01:49:51.869
different this year. And a lot of things where
he says, I'm smart, I got away with this,

01:49:51.869 --> 01:49:56.940
I do think that has some resonance in a country
of high-end social distrust. And I do think

01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:59.189
some of the rules are a little different applying
to him.

01:49:59.189 --> 01:50:02.579
MARK SHIELDS: Do you think those respectable
people who have come to him in the last few

01:50:02.579 --> 01:50:06.679
weeks, I mean, the thoughtful, have been kind
of overlooking it? Do you think they were

01:50:06.679 --> 01:50:07.679
made comfortable tonight?

01:50:07.679 --> 01:50:08.679
(CROSSTALK)

01:50:08.679 --> 01:50:09.679
DAVID BROOKS: Total squirming. Total squirming.

01:50:09.679 --> 01:50:10.679
(CROSSTALK)

01:50:10.679 --> 01:50:11.969
AMY WALTER: Yes. And that's really the question:
Did he pass the judgment test?

01:50:11.969 --> 01:50:16.269
But to the point of -- which I don't know
that he was able to pass the judgment, temperament

01:50:16.269 --> 01:50:19.929
test. I don't think that that was -- he gets
high marks on that.

01:50:19.929 --> 01:50:23.880
But on the question about where the country
feels that we're going, we're pretty evenly

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:27.169
divided between whether -- and this is the
Wall Street Journal poll -- is our country

01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:31.500
losing ground or is our country making progress?
Forty-eight percent say losing ground. Forty-five

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.039
percent say making progress.

01:50:33.039 --> 01:50:40.449
Not surprisingly, among white Americans, plus-11
losing ground, among nonwhite Americans, plus-28

01:50:40.449 --> 01:50:41.449
making progress.

01:50:41.449 --> 01:50:45.269
And so when you see these candidates literally
talking past each other, as you pointed out,

01:50:45.269 --> 01:50:48.019
on race issues, on so many other issues about
where we're going...

01:50:48.019 --> 01:50:49.019
GWEN IFILL: Taxes.

01:50:49.019 --> 01:50:52.030
AMY WALTER: ... on taxes, it's literally we
have a country that is seeing the direction

01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:53.030
that we're going in completely differently.

01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:56.810
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think all three of you were
saying before the debate that Hillary Clinton

01:50:56.810 --> 01:51:03.810
tonight needed to be more likable. She needed
to -- Mark, what was your term? She needed

01:51:03.810 --> 01:51:04.810
to...

01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:06.890
MARK SHIELDS: At the end of it, say, not a
bad egg.

01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:07.890
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not a bad egg.

01:51:07.890 --> 01:51:08.890
(CROSSTALK)

01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:11.249
MARK SHIELDS: Like to have in the carpool.

01:51:11.249 --> 01:51:13.090
JUDY WOODRUFF: But she did she do that tonight?

01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:14.449
MARK SHIELDS: In the PTA meeting.

01:51:14.449 --> 01:51:16.849
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did that happen or not?

01:51:16.849 --> 01:51:21.399
MARK SHIELDS: No. I don't think -- I don't
think -- she wasn't unlikable, but she certainly

01:51:21.399 --> 01:51:22.399
-- there wasn't any...

01:51:22.399 --> 01:51:23.399
AMY WALTER: What?

01:51:23.399 --> 01:51:27.959
MARK SHIELDS: There wasn't any point in which
you got a peek into her -- who she is, what

01:51:27.959 --> 01:51:28.979
makes her tick.

01:51:28.979 --> 01:51:32.280
GWEN IFILL: I never hear anybody ask whether
Donald Trump is likable.

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:33.809
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, sure we do.

01:51:33.809 --> 01:51:34.809
GWEN IFILL: Yes?

01:51:34.809 --> 01:51:35.809
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:51:35.809 --> 01:51:36.809
GWEN IFILL: Yes?

01:51:36.809 --> 01:51:37.809
MARK SHIELDS: And he's thoroughly unlikable.

01:51:37.809 --> 01:51:38.809
(CROSSTALK)

01:51:38.809 --> 01:51:39.809
DAVID BROOKS: It's not really an open question.

01:51:39.809 --> 01:51:40.809
GWEN IFILL: Oh, I see. Oh, I see.

01:51:40.809 --> 01:51:41.809
(CROSSTALK)

01:51:41.809 --> 01:51:46.719
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the Wall Street Journal/NBC
poll, to come back to what Amy was just talking

01:51:46.719 --> 01:51:51.939
about, he started 28/59 favorable/unfavorable,
and now he's at 29.

01:51:51.939 --> 01:51:56.829
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're going quickly back to
Hofstra university in New York.

01:51:56.829 --> 01:51:58.070
Our John Yang is there.

01:51:58.070 --> 01:52:01.340
John, you have maybe found a Trump person?

01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:02.969
GWEN IFILL: Hi, John.

01:52:02.969 --> 01:52:08.949
JOHN YANG: I have got -- we have been talking
to some of the Trump supporters here now.

01:52:08.949 --> 01:52:13.650
They think -- and the one point that they
have been repeating over and over again is

01:52:13.650 --> 01:52:18.109
the point, actually, that he repeated over
and over again in the debate, was hitting

01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:25.659
at Clinton as a career politician, that reinforcing
this idea that he's the -- that career politicians

01:52:25.659 --> 01:52:30.329
like Hillary Clinton are the reason for the
problems we're seeing now.

01:52:30.329 --> 01:52:35.050
That's been a signature line of his campaign
and, in many ways, one reason for a lot of

01:52:35.050 --> 01:52:39.379
the support of the campaign. And that's what
we're hearing over and over again from the

01:52:39.379 --> 01:52:40.829
Trump supporters here tonight.

01:52:40.829 --> 01:52:43.899
GWEN IFILL: In fact, John, that was one of
the big lines tonight, which is that she has

01:52:43.899 --> 01:52:47.959
experience, but it's bad experience, right?
And so they are picking up on that.

01:52:47.959 --> 01:52:49.760
JOHN YANG: Right.

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:52.769
JUDY WOODRUFF: So -- and, John, thank you.

01:52:52.769 --> 01:52:53.769
(CROSSTALK)

01:52:53.769 --> 01:52:54.769
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

01:52:54.769 --> 01:52:56.209
JOHN YANG: No, go ahead.

01:52:56.209 --> 01:53:01.250
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was just going to bring it
back here and say to David, is that effective?

01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:03.749
Is that something that sticks that he keeps
repeating?

01:53:03.749 --> 01:53:05.409
DAVID BROOKS: I think it does, actually.

01:53:05.409 --> 01:53:09.619
If you looked at her, just take him out of
the debate, she does look like a career politician.

01:53:09.619 --> 01:53:13.579
She does repeat a lot of things. She doesn't
quite make human convention -- connection.

01:53:13.579 --> 01:53:17.209
And in year that's very unusual, she's not
that unusual.

01:53:17.209 --> 01:53:22.690
But I thought she did fine, and with some
devastatingly good assaults. But, again, as

01:53:22.690 --> 01:53:25.820
Mark said, he was the subject. And he did
negative.

01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:28.789
AMY WALTER: Well, and that's been the theme
throughout this campaign, right?

01:53:28.789 --> 01:53:33.959
Wherever the spotlight goes, if it's placed
on you, the candidate, you are likely to drop

01:53:33.959 --> 01:53:37.019
in the polls. When the spotlight gets to the
other candidate -- because this race has just

01:53:37.019 --> 01:53:39.649
simply been a referendum on who the worst
candidate is, right?

01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:44.150
And so when it -- if it goes to the spotlight
now on Donald Trump and how much he was on

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:48.090
defense, it's not going to be how well Clinton
did as much as how poorly he did. And if it

01:53:48.090 --> 01:53:53.260
goes over to Hillary Clinton, then she becomes
the focus. Her numbers suffer.

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:58.619
And at the end of the day, the candidate who
wins is the candidate who doesn't get in that

01:53:58.619 --> 01:54:00.599
spotlight for the last couple of weeks.

01:54:00.599 --> 01:54:04.789
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask a question about just
one big policy issue that he seemed to land

01:54:04.789 --> 01:54:09.429
a few blows on. And that was on trade, when
he kind of basically made the point that she

01:54:09.429 --> 01:54:13.079
had changed her mind. And he drove that point
home.

01:54:13.079 --> 01:54:15.709
MARK SHIELDS: He did.

01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:16.709
(CROSSTALK)

01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:21.030
MARK SHIELDS: The question I had, as he was
doing that, was -- are his interruptions a

01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:23.190
sign of strength or obnoxiousness?

01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:28.369
But he -- there's no question, he dominated
the dialogue. She was very much playing defense

01:54:28.369 --> 01:54:30.280
in the first part there.

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:34.709
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as David said, in the
first half-hour, it seemed to be that he was

01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:36.820
getting the better of a couple of points.

01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:41.859
But then, as we moved into the debate, it
seemed to me Hillary Clinton felt more comfortable

01:54:41.859 --> 01:54:44.540
coming after him and sticking with some...

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:45.540
(CROSSTALK)

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:47.530
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, she baited him. There's
no question.

01:54:47.530 --> 01:54:48.820
AMY WALTER: Oh, yes.

01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:53.909
The Donald was baited. And he not, in that
sense, go after her the way I thought he would.

01:54:53.909 --> 01:54:57.889
I thought his own defense of his positions
was really faulty.

01:54:57.889 --> 01:55:00.789
GWEN IFILL: Well, time for all three of you
to ask -- really quick answers.

01:55:00.789 --> 01:55:01.789
AMY WALTER: Uh-oh.

01:55:01.789 --> 01:55:04.409
GWEN IFILL: Expectations in advance, did they
meet your expectations afterward?

01:55:04.409 --> 01:55:06.760
AMY WALTER: Yes, they did.

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.170
GWEN IFILL: OK.

01:55:08.170 --> 01:55:09.170
Mark?

01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:10.170
MARK SHIELDS: No.

01:55:10.170 --> 01:55:11.170
(LAUGHTER)

01:55:11.170 --> 01:55:13.609
MARK SHIELDS: My expectations have never been
met. No.

01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:15.609
JUDY WOODRUFF: We may ask you this question
again tomorrow.

01:55:15.609 --> 01:55:16.609
David?

01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:20.119
DAVID BROOKS: Not a kamikaze night for him.
So, it's not a career-ender, not a campaign-ender,

01:55:20.119 --> 01:55:21.510
but not a good night.

01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:24.219
GWEN IFILL: All right. I think I gave you,
like, one word.

01:55:24.219 --> 01:55:25.219
AMY WALTER: Yes.

01:55:25.219 --> 01:55:28.829
But I can say -- yes, agree that it was a
better night for Hillary Clinton, but it does

01:55:28.829 --> 01:55:32.349
not feel like it was the defining end-all,
be-all of this campaign.

01:55:32.349 --> 01:55:34.479
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, hey, we have only got
six weeks to go.

01:55:34.479 --> 01:55:37.280
GWEN IFILL: You know what that means. We are
going to have to come back and do it again

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:42.079
right here at this table, maybe October 4
for the vice presidential debate.

01:55:42.079 --> 01:55:47.010
That concludes our coverage of the first presidential
debate, but there's whole lot more, as we

01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:52.010
were saying, online. You can watch highlights.
Plus, see how "NewsHour" staff, from Margaret

01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:57.309
Warner to Paul Solman, as you were saying,
and more put what the candidates said in context.

01:55:57.309 --> 01:55:58.309
That's all at PBS.org/NewsHour.

01:55:58.309 --> 01:55:59.769
I'm Gwen Ifill.

01:55:59.769 --> 01:56:01.920
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy Woodruff.

01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:04.590
And join us right here for the "NewsHour"
tomorrow night.

01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:40.939
For all of us at the "PBS NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
