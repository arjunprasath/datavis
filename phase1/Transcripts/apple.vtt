Thank you.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:55.054
Before we start with
the keynote,

00:00:55.054 --> 00:01:01.026
we'd like to take a moment
to talk about the tragedy

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:04.930
that occurred yesterday
in Orlando, Florida.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.534 line:92%
We offer our deepest sympathies

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:14.306
to everyone whose lives were
touched by this violence.

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:20.813
It was senseless, unconscionable
act of terrorism and hate,

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:25.117
aimed at dividing
and destroying.

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:32.024
The Apple community is
made up of people from all

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:36.295
around the world, from
all different backgrounds

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:39.298
and all different
points of view.

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:43.068 line:92%
We celebrate our diversity.

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:47.239
We know that it makes
us stronger

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.142 line:92%
and moves everyone forward.

00:01:52.811 --> 00:02:00.085
Please rise and join us
in a moment of silence

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:06.592
to honor the victims and
the people who loved them.

Hello and welcome to WWDC 2016.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:40.993
It's great to be here at the
legendary Bill Graham Auditorium

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:43.429 line:92%
in beautiful San Francisco.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:48.200
We have a really big and
jam-packed morning planned

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.336
for you, and we couldn't
be more excited.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.772
Let me give you some details
on the conference this year.

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:58.344
This is our 27th Worldwide
Developers Conference.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:02.114
The developer community has
never been more vibrant.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:05.784
We now have 13 million
registered developers

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:09.455
with 2 million added
in the last year alone.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:15.995
The conference this year
sold out over 5000 attendees

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.798
and millions more watching
on the live stream.

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:23.202
This is truly a worldwide
conference.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:28.741
We have people here
from over 74 countries.

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:32.211
We're excited that
we're attracting

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.880 line:92%
so many new developers.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.283 line:92%
Over 70% of the attendees

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:40.252
at the conference this year
are attending the conference

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.755 line:92%
for the very first time.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:47.359
Now, we're investing in the
next generation of developers.

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.531
We've awarded 350
scholarships this year.

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.172 line:92%
These guys are incredible.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:03.776
If you see them, make sure
that you congratulate them.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:07.346
We have over 100 attendees
at the conference this year

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:10.916 line:92%
that are under 18 years of age.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:19.858
The youngest, the
youngest is only nine.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.866
Wow. I met her yesterday
and she is going

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:30.869
to make one heck of
a great developer.

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:38.977
This week is about
helping you get the most

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:40.512 line:92%
out of our platforms.

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:43.349
So we have over 100
engineering-led sessions

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.621
and over 150 hands-on labs
with over 1000 Apple engineers

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:52.891
on site here to help
you through the week.

00:04:52.891 --> 00:05:00.065
The App Store started eight
years ago with only 500 apps.

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:05.871
Recently, we passed
a major milestone.

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:11.477
We now have 2 million
apps on the App Store.

[ Applause ]

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:25.324
Your 2 million apps had been
downloaded 130 billion times.

00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:33.232
And as you know, the App Store
is the best business opportunity

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.767 line:92%
for developers.

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:40.873
We're about to pass $50 billion
paid directly to developers.

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:43.409 line:92%
This is absolutely amazing.

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:50.349
And of course, successful
developers translates

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.019
to us having the best apps
on our platform for users

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.355 line:92%
and this is what really matters.

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:59.091
Now, we have a busy
morning planned but I'd

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.660 line:92%
like to take a moment to talk

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.363
about why we do what
we do at Apple.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:12.171
Our north star has always been
about improving people's lives

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:16.141
by creating great products
that change the world.

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:19.778
And we've been doing
this for a long time.

00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:25.451
But today, for the very first
time, we're going to talk to you

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:29.388 line:92%
about four Apple platforms.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:34.593
Each of these platforms
is category-defining

00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:36.995 line:92%
and world-changing.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:41.700

personal computing.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.136 line:92%
Today, it's the most innovative

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:47.439
and loved personal
computer on the planet.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:51.109 line:92%
iPhone changed phones forever.

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:55.214
It's the best smartphone
experience and the gold standard

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:58.183
by which everything
else is measured.

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:03.989
The iPad magically transforms
a glass canvas into anything

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:05.858 line:92%
that you want it to be.

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:08.560

expression of the future

Apple Watch, only one year old,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.638
it's already the ultimate
device for a healthy life.

00:07:19.638 --> 00:07:25.143
And Apple TV just announced
last fall based on the idea

00:07:25.143 --> 00:07:28.113 line:92%
that the future of TV is apps,

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:32.584
it's already transforming the
biggest screen in our homes.

00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:36.822
Now, we love creating
great apps,

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:40.826
we love creating great
products that change the world,

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:44.730 line:92%
but we can't do it alone.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.067
Developers are a crucial
part of that journey.

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:54.606
You are about-- You are a
part of everything that we do,

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:58.043
and everything that we
will do going forward.

00:07:58.043 --> 00:08:02.748
Because it's together that
we enrich people's lives.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:08.020
Now, we offer you four
incredible platforms

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.558
that power these world-changing
product experiences.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:17.362 line:92%
watchOS, tvOS, OS X, iOS.

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:24.670
We're going to move each of
these platforms forward today

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.307
and we'd like to get
started with watchOS.

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:32.044
And to do that, I'd like
to invite Kevin Lynch up.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Tim.

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.090
So I am really excited to
talk with you about watchOS

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.625
and show you some
of what's ahead.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:50.228
Now, people who are using Apple
Watch love it, particularly

00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:53.699
for quick glances at information
and quick interactions.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.835
And our top focus is performance
and we've made optimizations

00:08:56.835 --> 00:09:00.205
across the entire system
including a serious acceleration

00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:02.040 line:92%
in app launch time.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.443
Your app should actually
respond instantly.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:10.015 line:92%
The information you look

00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:11.783
at should be updated
before you go look,

00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:14.286
so it's ready the instant that
you are so you're not waiting.

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:18.790
In watchOS 3, your favorite
apps can respond instantly.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.125 line:92%
So let's take a look.

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:21.560
So we're going to
accomplish this

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.195
by keeping your favorite
apps in memory.

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.497
We're going to support
background updates of data

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:27.699
and refresh the information
so it's ready the instant

00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:30.669
that you are, and then we
support quickly launching these

00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:31.937 line:92%
apps and interacting with them.

00:09:31.937 --> 00:09:34.606
This is going to work for
both the built-in apps

00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:36.775 line:92%
and third-party apps.

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:38.744 line:92%
Let's take a look at an example.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:41.279
This is watchOS 2 and
we're going to look

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:42.681 line:92%
at an app called Onefootball.

00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.616
We're going to launch it from
the complication the bottom left

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:47.452
and we're going to
see how long it takes.

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:50.389
So here we are launching
the app, takes a few seconds

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:53.158
to launch, and then once it
launches, it loads some data,

00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:55.560 line:92%
and it updates, there we go.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.197
So that is a pretty typical
example of watchOS 2.

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:00.198 line:92%
Now, we're going to take a look

00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:03.168
at Onefootball launching
in watchOS 3.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:05.303 line:92%
Are you guys ready?

00:10:05.303 --> 00:10:07.572 line:92%
OK, don't blink.

00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:08.507 line:92%

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:19.484
So that example is about seven
times faster but it feels

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:22.254 line:92%
like a million times faster.

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:23.321
So now, we've made
it really easy

00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:25.357 line:92%
to access your favorite apps.

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.626
You can just press the
side button below the crown

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:29.394 line:92%
to show what we call the dock.

00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:30.962
You can choose which
apps go here

00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:33.532
and you can quickly
scroll through them.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:40.472
The apps are now both glanceable
and interactive rather

00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:42.074 line:92%
than separate concepts.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.208 line:92%
This is a dramatic improvement

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:45.310
in how it feels to
use the watch.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.479
So this increased performance
allowed us to have access

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:48.980 line:92%
to our favorite apps quickly.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.450
We want to be able to
access them anywhere.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.819
So by using the side button,
we can get to them easily.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.088
Now, another key
design goal we had was

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.223
to make the watch
feel more familiar.

00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:00.525
And so we've done
with the watch face,

00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:01.626 line:92%
now we've added control center.

00:11:01.626 --> 00:11:02.861
You just swipe up
from the bottom,

00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:06.498
just like on iOS,
and very familiar.

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:09.935 line:92%
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.838
So this is a giant improvement
at how it feels to use apps

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:17.275
and to navigate the watch very
simply and easily in watchOS 3.

00:11:17.275 --> 00:11:20.045
Now, we've also made it more
powerful to reply to messages.

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:23.448
So now, when you receive a
message, you can see the ways

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:24.316 line:92%
to respond right there.

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:25.450 line:92%
We've removed this step.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.585
You don't have to
actually press reply now.

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:28.019
You can just pick the
way you'd like to reply.

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:29.688 line:92%
And if you just scroll down,

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.957
you'll see your smart replies
right below the message.

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:35.660
So you can just tap reply
in less than a second.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.063
Now sometimes, you don't see
exactly the response you like

00:11:38.063 --> 00:11:41.266
and you're not in a situation
where you can use dictation,

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:42.467 line:92%
so wouldn't it be great

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:44.202
if you can just write
your message on the watch?

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:46.972
Well, we're introducing a new
way to do that with something

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:49.274 line:92%
that we call Scribble.

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:51.076
With Scribble, you have
a new way to respond just

00:11:51.076 --> 00:11:52.644
by writing what you
like on the screen,

00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:54.212
and you can just
quickly draw the letters

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:55.680 line:92%
for your message right there

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.616
like writing something
like Starbucks.

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:00.485
You can see the letters go
right on top of each other.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:10.128
So that's a great new way to
respond with just the response

00:12:10.128 --> 00:12:11.596 line:92%
that you like on your watch.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:14.866
Now, the watch face is
great for quick looks

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:16.201 line:92%
and it reflects your style

00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:17.669
and it's also the
character of the device.

00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:20.972
Now, we've had Mickey as a fun
watch face that I like to use

00:12:20.972 --> 00:12:23.875
on weekends but I know what my
daughter is going to really love

00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:27.045
because Minnie is
coming to the watch now.

00:12:30.415 --> 00:12:32.317
And of course, you can choose
from a variety of colors

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.253
for her outfit that match
her bands perfectly.

00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:38.790
Now, one of the most frequent
things people do is look

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.925 line:92%
at their activity rings

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.893
and we're adding a new
watch face specifically

00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:44.963
for that called Activity, so
it's a great beautiful way

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:47.299
to see your rings
throughout the day.

00:12:50.902 --> 00:12:52.571
It comes not only in
the analog version

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.472
but also a really nice
chronograph version

00:12:54.472 --> 00:12:57.475
and a digital version, so a
super good way for looking

00:12:57.475 --> 00:12:59.444 line:92%
at your progress during the day.

00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:02.180
We've also added a really simple
new face that we call Numerals,

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.483
which is very beautiful,
and the hours actually go

00:13:05.483 --> 00:13:08.520
around the dial during day, and
you can choose from a variety

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.288 line:92%
of fonts that match your style,

00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:12.791
so a really simple new
watch face called Numerals.

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:15.527
Now, there's a lot of
watch faces to choose from

00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:17.529
and we're finding that
people are actually switching

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:20.232
between faces for different
occasions, so we're going

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.033 line:92%
to make that super easy.

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:25.437
You can now just swipe to switch
the face you'd like to use,

00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:27.038
and you can choose
which faces you'd like

00:13:27.038 --> 00:13:30.041
and how they're configured so
you can easily get to them.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:33.211
We've also added the ability to
add more complications to faces

00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:35.347
like Weather here
on the photo's face.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:37.315
So now, really simple
to navigate

00:13:37.315 --> 00:13:39.351
and use your watch
faces as well.

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:40.785
Let's see all of this
stuff running live.

welcome Stacey Lysik.

I could not be more excited
to have the opportunity

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:58.003 line:92%
to show you watchOS 3 today.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:01.406
I wake up to my favorite
new face,

00:14:01.406 --> 00:14:04.609
just the girl I've
been looking for.

00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:07.812
Now, in watchOS 3, you
have a place to keep all

of your favorite apps.

00:14:09.214 --> 00:14:11.583
You choose which apps go in your
dock and you choose the order.

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:14.352
I can bring up my dock by
pressing the side button.

00:14:14.352 --> 00:14:17.756
And I can swipe through my apps
one at a time or lay my finger

00:14:17.756 --> 00:14:19.991
down in these dots at the
bottom of the screen and fly

00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:21.660
through my dock to
get to any app.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.163
And the apps in my
dock are live,

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:27.365
so I can get a quick
glance at information

00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:29.467
without even launching an
app like how close I am

00:14:29.467 --> 00:14:31.803 line:92%
to closing my activity rings.

00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:33.939
And the apps have been
redesigned to put me

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:36.107
within one tap of the
thing I most want to do.

00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:38.843
Let's take a look
at the Timer app.

00:14:38.843 --> 00:14:42.113
One tap to launch it and it's
right there waiting for me.

00:14:42.113 --> 00:14:46.217
I can still set a custom timer
if that's what I want to do,

00:14:46.217 --> 00:14:47.352 line:92%
but the most common choices

00:14:47.352 --> 00:14:49.521
for a timer are right
here on the screen.

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:52.123
So with one tap, I can
set a 10-minute timer

00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:55.460
and get right back
to what I was doing.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.097
Even my favorite apps from the
App Store can be in my dock

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:03.568
like Sweat with Kayla, and Lyft,
and they are lightning fast too.

quick interaction.

Now, I can keep all my lists
with me throughout the day

00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:28.727

off as I get them done.

one of those days.

latest and greatest location

apps on your dock.

for a casual weekend,

something simple and elegant.

And we're going to be able
to help with that with SOS

make it easy to call for help.

To activate it, you just press

It's going to countdown to
let you know it's calling 911.

to be on a live call

with the emergency services
right on your watch.

This works either as a cellular
call via your iPhone or directly

from the watch if
you're connected to WiFi.

the watch will automatically
notify your emergency contacts,

00:18:26.304 --> 00:18:27.705 line:92%
they'll send them a message.

00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:30.975
The message also will include
a map of your current location

00:18:30.975 --> 00:18:32.143 line:92%
so they know where you are

00:18:32.143 --> 00:18:34.245

with each other.

your watch will actually
now show your medical ID

which is also a new
feature in watchOS.

00:18:40.885 --> 00:18:43.555
It has things like for
example your age and allergies

and other information
you'd like to put there.

00:18:45.723 --> 00:18:48.560
And SOS works not
only just in the US

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.195 line:92%
but it works internationally.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.564
So for example you might
be traveling to some place

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:55.667
like Hong Kong and you might not
know what the emergency number

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:58.503
is to call but your
Apple Watch does.

[ Applause ]

00:19:05.743 --> 00:19:08.980
So in this case, it calls
999 rather than 911.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.249
So this is an emergency
feature that isn't one

00:19:11.249 --> 00:19:13.151
that you'll use often
but when you need it,

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:14.986
it's going to be
there and that's SOS.

Now, one of the primary reasons
people are wearing the watch

they actually become more active

because they become addicted
to closing the activity rings.

So with watchOS, we're
introducing activity sharing.

00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:11.743 line:92%
And it couldn't be simpler.

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:13.645
All you have to do
is swipe to the right

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:15.480 line:92%
of your own activity rings

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.382
and there you'll see
your selected family

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.750 line:92%
and friend's rings as well.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.887
Now you can sort by whatever
metric is most important to you.

00:20:22.887 --> 00:20:25.990
So you can sort by steps,
you can sort by workouts,

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.059
you can even sort
by exercise minutes.

00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:31.329
Here you'll see that I've sorted
by the move ring and I'm right

00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:32.730 line:92%
where you'd expect me to be.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.068
I'm getting by butt kicked by
Stacey but I'm annihilating Jeff

00:20:37.068 --> 00:20:40.204 line:92%
which makes me very happy.

00:20:40.204 --> 00:20:43.341
If you want to see more details,
all you do is tap on anyone

00:20:43.341 --> 00:20:46.077
on your activity list and
you'll get an up close look

00:20:46.077 --> 00:20:49.180
at their activity rings,
but you can also see things

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.715 line:92%
like their daily step count

00:20:50.715 --> 00:20:54.485
and their workouts even
from third parties.

00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:56.888
But one of my favorite
features is

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.956
that you can communicate
directly with the people

00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:00.758
that you're sharing
activity with right

00:21:00.758 --> 00:21:03.695
in the Activity app
through messages.

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:06.731
And when you do, you'll get
smart replies that are geared

00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:08.966 line:92%
around fitness and activity.

00:21:08.966 --> 00:21:13.338
Some are supportive, some
are a little more competitive

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.039
but you can also
do some fun things.

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.641
For example, at the
end of a workout,

00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:18.209
you could send your
raising heart rate to one

00:21:18.209 --> 00:21:19.577 line:92%
of your activity friends.

00:21:19.577 --> 00:21:25.950
Or your raising heart rate to
one of your activity friends

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:30.054
or you can also send smack
talk in your own voice right

00:21:30.054 --> 00:21:31.823 line:92%
through audio messages.

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.624
So we think this is going
to be a great way for you

00:21:33.624 --> 00:21:35.493
and your friends
to stay motivated

00:21:35.493 --> 00:21:40.164
to keep each other active and
we can't wait for you to try it.

00:21:40.164 --> 00:21:43.267
Now, our team has been
working hard to enable features

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:44.635 line:92%
that would allow more people

00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:47.205
to use the Activity
and Workout apps.

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.673
And one group we've
been thinking a lot

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:51.609 line:92%
about is wheelchair users.

00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:54.612
Now, many wheelchair users
already have an Apple Watch.

00:21:54.612 --> 00:21:57.115
And they've witnessed and
told us that they love it

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:59.217
because it gives them
instant access to messages

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:00.885
and notifications
right from their wrist.

00:22:00.885 --> 00:22:02.954
And this is particularly
important

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:04.689
because many wheelchair
users have

00:22:04.689 --> 00:22:08.226
to tuck away their iPhone
securely throughout the day.

00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:11.062
But to do a great activity
and workout experience,

00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:13.531
we also recognize that we
couldn't just use the same

00:22:13.531 --> 00:22:15.933
algorithms that we've used
for non-wheelchair users

00:22:15.933 --> 00:22:19.303
because the biomechanics
are completely different.

00:22:19.303 --> 00:22:22.240
For example, many wheelchair
users use a semicircular

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.208
technique when they're pushing
their wheelchair throughout

00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:25.543 line:92%
the day.

00:22:25.543 --> 00:22:28.679
But as the terrain changes
and the speed changes,

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:30.615
they may switch to
an arc technique

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.683 line:92%
or a single-loop over technique.

00:22:32.683 --> 00:22:34.285
And this is what
makes it complicated.

00:22:34.285 --> 00:22:37.321
These are only a few of the
techniques that they may use.

00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:40.558
We knew that to do this right,
we not only have to do a lot

00:22:40.558 --> 00:22:42.760
of studies but we
would also need

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.029 line:92%
to enlist the help of experts.

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:47.532
So, we worked with the
Challenged Athletes Foundation

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.167 line:92%
and the Lakeshore Foundation.

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:51.803
These are two of the
world's largest organizations

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:54.038
that are dedicated to
promoting physical fitness

00:22:54.038 --> 00:22:56.140 line:92%
for people in wheelchairs.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.043
With their help, we were
able to conduct the studies.

00:22:59.043 --> 00:23:00.878
And we were able to do
it on a wide variety

00:23:00.878 --> 00:23:03.915
of wheelchair users
including some veterans.

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:07.285
And now, wheelchair users
will have a setting.

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:11.489
The time to stand notifications
will be changed to time to roll.

00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:17.829 line:92%
[ Applause ]

00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:19.230 line:92%
There will be two workouts

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.066
in the workout apps specifically
dedicated to wheelchair users

00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:24.836
and of course the activity
rings will be optimized

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:26.704 line:92%
for wheelchair pushes.

00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:29.307
We could not be more
excited about this feature

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:31.142
and we're incredibly
thankful to our partners

00:23:31.142 --> 00:23:33.511 line:92%
for helping make it possible.

[ Applause ]

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.552
Now, one of the things that
we've learned about health

00:23:41.552 --> 00:23:43.387
in Apple Watch is
that simple things

00:23:43.387 --> 00:23:45.890
like the activity rings
can be very powerful

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.159
at helping people
change behavior.

00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:49.994
But we also know that
there's a lot more

00:23:49.994 --> 00:23:52.063 line:92%
to health than just fitness.

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.732
And we've been thinking
way beyond that.

00:23:54.732 --> 00:23:57.869
So with watchOS, we're
launching a brand new app

00:23:57.869 --> 00:24:00.671 line:92%
for health, it's called Breathe.

00:24:00.671 --> 00:24:02.373 line:92%
And it's designed to guide you

00:24:02.373 --> 00:24:04.642
through simple deep
breathing sessions

00:24:04.642 --> 00:24:08.012
that can help you quiet
your mind, relax your body

00:24:08.012 --> 00:24:11.883
and just better deal
with everyday stress.

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:14.952
Now, yoga practitioners have
been using deep breathing

00:24:14.952 --> 00:24:17.455
exercises for thousands
of years as a way

00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:19.957
to positively impact
the body and mind.

00:24:19.957 --> 00:24:22.960
But the medical community has
also embraced deep breathing

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.429
as a great way to
improve daily health.

00:24:25.429 --> 00:24:28.666
Dr. Deepak Chopra, one
of the early advocates

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:32.036
of body-mind medicine has said,
"Taking a moment every day

00:24:32.036 --> 00:24:34.672
to do some deep breathing
can reduce stress,

00:24:34.672 --> 00:24:36.340 line:92%
calm the body-mind as well

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.576
as have a long term
health benefits."

00:24:38.576 --> 00:24:41.913
Now to get to the
app, it's easy.

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:44.282
You can launch it from your
watch face, you can launch it

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:48.452
from the dock or like
the stand reminders,

00:24:48.452 --> 00:24:51.556
you can actually set smart
notifications to remind you

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:55.893
and start building this as
a habit every single day.

00:24:55.893 --> 00:24:58.896
When you open the app, you
can easily change the amount

00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:00.298
of time you want
to do your session,

00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:04.769
from one to five minutes just
by turning the digital crown.

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:07.838
And when you're in the app
experience, you'll be guided

00:25:07.838 --> 00:25:11.208
by beautiful visuals that make
it really easy to follow along.

00:25:11.208 --> 00:25:14.045
And if you prefer to do
this with your eyes closed,

00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:16.047
you can turn on the
haptic feedback

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:18.716 line:92%
and gentle taps will guide you

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:21.118
and you can do without
even looking.

00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:23.821
When the session is over,
you'll get a summary.

00:25:23.821 --> 00:25:26.123
And you'll also get your heart
rate from the last few seconds

00:25:26.123 --> 00:25:28.225 line:92%
of the session you just did.

00:25:28.225 --> 00:25:30.428
Now if you already
do deep breathing,

00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:32.263
we think this is going to be
a great way for you to fit it

00:25:32.263 --> 00:25:33.965 line:92%
into your day more often.

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:35.900
But for those of you that
don't, we think this is going

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.970
to be a great way to get started
and just one more simple way

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.372
that it can help you
live a better day.

00:25:41.372 --> 00:25:43.908
These are just a few of the
exciting updates we have planned

00:25:43.908 --> 00:25:45.509
for fitness and health
in watchOS.

00:25:45.509 --> 00:25:48.512

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jay.

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:57.221 line:92%
That was really terrific.

00:25:57.221 --> 00:25:59.256
I was actually using the
Breathe app back stage.

00:25:59.256 --> 00:26:00.758 line:92%
It helped me a bit.

00:26:00.758 --> 00:26:07.431
So, watchOS 3 is a giant step
forward for you as developers.

00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:10.067
When someone adds your apps
to dock or to the watch face,

00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:12.370
it benefits from all the
instant launch experience

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.405
that we're showing and
you get background time

00:26:14.405 --> 00:26:16.974
to update your information
before someone goes and looks.

00:26:16.974 --> 00:26:19.210
And that will enable
really quick interactions

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.978 line:92%
with your app on the watch.

00:26:20.978 --> 00:26:23.214
Now you can already build
apps that are native to watch

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.915
that you can run
independent of iPhone,

00:26:24.915 --> 00:26:26.517 line:92%
but we're also adding a number

00:26:26.517 --> 00:26:28.119
of new APIs you can
take advantage

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:30.721
of when you're building
apps for the watch.

00:26:30.721 --> 00:26:33.591
One of those is support now
for Apple Pay within your app

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.827
on the watch, so you can
do purchases right there.

00:26:36.827 --> 00:26:38.062 line:92%
Fitness apps will now be able

00:26:38.062 --> 00:26:40.665
to run the background during
workouts enabling access

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:43.334
to real-time heart rate
information and motion data.

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:45.636
This is going to enable
a whole new category

00:26:45.636 --> 00:26:48.305 line:92%
of fitness apps on the watch.

00:26:48.305 --> 00:26:51.509
Also we're enabling a much
richer and expressive apps

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:54.578
in watchOS including support
for SpriteKit and SceneKit,

00:26:54.578 --> 00:26:59.216
native event support from the
crown and for touch gestures.

across devices

with Game Center and CloudKit.

going to be amazing.

&gt;&gt; So let's talk about
tvOS and Apple TV.

00:28:02.012 --> 00:28:05.316
Last fall, we introduced the
next generation of Apple TV

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:08.786
and for the first time,
developers had a modern platform

00:28:08.786 --> 00:28:12.189
like iOS to develop
for in the living room.

00:28:12.189 --> 00:28:15.760
And we said the future
of TV is apps.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.330
And the response to Apple
TV has been incredible.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:23.100
Here is what Chris Albrecht
the CEO of Starz had to say.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.203
tvOS has allowed Starz
to create an experience

00:28:26.203 --> 00:28:29.006
on Apple TV unlike
anything we've done before

00:28:29.006 --> 00:28:31.909

are loving it.

We easily extended our iOS game
experience to the living room,

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.619
something that is
incredibly difficult to do

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.854 line:92%
on traditional consoles.

00:28:43.854 --> 00:28:47.658
Our last generation Apple TV
had 80 video channels and thanks

00:28:47.658 --> 00:28:52.496
to many of you, we now have
over 1300 video channels.

00:28:57.434 --> 00:29:01.639
And we have over 6000 native
apps in just seven months.

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:04.074
And I've got some new
apps to tell you about.

00:29:04.074 --> 00:29:06.844
First, Sling which
offers a great selection

00:29:06.844 --> 00:29:09.980
of live cable channels is
coming to Apple TV today.

00:29:12.983 --> 00:29:17.988
Fox Sports Go, I'm a huge
sports fan, four sports game all

00:29:17.988 --> 00:29:22.193
at the same time on one screen
coming this summer to Apple TV.

00:29:25.329 --> 00:29:28.632
Molotov, a revolutionary
new TV service in France

00:29:28.632 --> 00:29:32.803
with over 100 live channels
video on demand exclusively

00:29:32.803 --> 00:29:37.208
on iOS and Apple TV
coming next month.

00:29:40.444 --> 00:29:44.114
Great sports games like
NBA 2K, adventure games

00:29:44.114 --> 00:29:47.785
like Minecraft story
mode and SketchParty.

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:50.554
Use your iPhone or iPad
to draw and then you sit

00:29:50.554 --> 00:29:52.189 line:92%
around the TV to guess.

00:29:52.189 --> 00:29:55.926
It's a lot of fun to do this
with your group of friends.

00:29:55.926 --> 00:29:58.662
Now we've got great updates
to tell you about for tvOS

00:29:58.662 --> 00:30:02.466
and let me start with
the Apple TV remote app.

00:30:02.466 --> 00:30:05.603
Now Apple TV comes with
the incredible Siri remote.

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:08.772
It uses touch for navigation,
Siri to tell it what you want

00:30:08.772 --> 00:30:11.775
to watch, and motion
to play games.

00:30:11.775 --> 00:30:13.344
But a lot of our
customers have told us

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.446
that they would love
an app on their iPhone

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.648
that had all those
same capabilities,

00:30:17.648 --> 00:30:20.384
and so we're making a new
version of the remote app.

00:30:20.384 --> 00:30:21.452 line:92%
This is what it looks like.

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:22.987
It's got a beautiful
mount playing screen

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:25.189
with playback controls,
but most importantly,

00:30:25.189 --> 00:30:27.791
all the features
of the Siri remote.

00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:31.161
You have touch for navigation,
Siri to give it commands,

00:30:31.161 --> 00:30:35.532
and it uses the accelerometer
and gyroscope to play games.

[ Applause ]

00:30:40.537 --> 00:30:44.441
And of course, you can enter
text with the keyboard.

00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:48.913 line:92%
Next let's talk about Siri.

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:51.649
Siri changed the way we
interact with our television

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:54.652
because now we just tell
it what we want to watch.

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.353 line:92%
And we're making it even better

00:30:56.353 --> 00:30:59.590
because now you can
search movies by topics.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.126
Now my daughter is actually
going to high school this fall

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:04.228
and I remember back when
I went to high school,

00:31:04.228 --> 00:31:06.330
it's been a while, there
are some great movies

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.299 line:92%
that I'd love to watch with her.

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:12.002
And now Siri makes this really
easy because I can just say,

00:31:12.002 --> 00:31:13.938
find high school
comedies from the 80s.

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:14.638 line:92%
I'm sorry.

00:31:14.638 --> 00:31:15.639 line:92%
We'll do that one again.

00:31:15.639 --> 00:31:17.975
Find high school
comedies from the 80s.

00:31:17.975 --> 00:31:21.979
And there are some
of my favorites.

00:31:21.979 --> 00:31:23.347
I actually have watched
them all.

00:31:23.347 --> 00:31:25.049
Let's take a look at
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off"

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:29.019
and with just one tap,
we can start watching.

00:31:33.023 --> 00:31:38.162
Now Siri actually searches over
650,000 movies and TV shows now,

00:31:38.162 --> 00:31:40.965 line:92%
but what about YouTube?

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:44.268
Well, that's easy too
because now you just ask Siri.

00:31:44.268 --> 00:31:49.606
Search YouTube for Steph
Curry three pointers.

00:31:51.842 --> 00:31:55.245
Siri launches YouTube and
shows you the results.

00:31:55.245 --> 00:31:58.382
But a big part of your TV
experience is live channels.

00:31:58.382 --> 00:32:02.086
And we've got some great
channels on Apple TV like ABC,

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:05.389
CBS, FX and a lot more that
give you live channels.

00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:08.425
But to start watching,
you got to find the app,

00:32:08.425 --> 00:32:10.461
you got to launch it and then
you got to find the channel.

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:13.731
Well, we've got a great new
feature called Live Tune-In.

00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:18.469
And all you have to
do-- watch ESPN 2.

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:21.705
Take them straight
to the action.

00:32:21.705 --> 00:32:23.507 line:92%

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:31.215
&gt;&gt; And this is already working
with a lot of great channels

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:34.118
and we're making Live
Tune-In available

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:38.389
on both your iPad
and Apple TV as well.

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:42.359
And one problem with this is,
let's be honest, when you go in

00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:44.728
and you launch a video
channel app for the first time,

00:32:44.728 --> 00:32:47.598 line:92%
you get something like this.

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:49.867
And you got to go find
a browser, authenticate

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:52.903
with a code and then
authenticate

00:32:52.903 --> 00:32:54.204 line:92%
to your TV provider.

00:32:54.204 --> 00:32:57.174
Well, we're going to make
this change a little bit.

00:32:57.174 --> 00:33:00.277
But it's worst because you got
to do it for each in every app.

00:33:00.277 --> 00:33:02.679
And now, we're going
to make it all go away

00:33:02.679 --> 00:33:05.482
with the feature we
call single sign-on.

we-- A page on the after,

00:33:19.863 --> 00:33:22.900
we'll show you all of the apps
that you now have access to.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.135
And of course, we're
bringing this to iOS as well.

00:33:25.135 --> 00:33:27.137
Now in addition to
single sign-on,

00:33:27.137 --> 00:33:28.906
we've got some other
great updates.

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:31.341
Now Apple TV looks
beautiful but there are times

00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:33.510
where you wish it was darker
because you're in a home theater

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.447
or a dark room and
now that's really easy

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:39.516
because you can just
switch to dark mode.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.155
And we want to make
it even easier

00:33:45.155 --> 00:33:47.491 line:92%

broadcast your gameplay

or save the video
to share it later.

it gives you access

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:30.300
to your complete
iCloud photo library,

all the videos, all the photos.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:35.005
And of course HomeKit

to control all the devices
in your-- on-- at home.

00:34:37.908 --> 00:34:41.145
And that's just some of the
many features we've got.

I'm actually talking about
the name OS X itself.

something sticks out.

00:36:14.905 --> 00:36:18.442
We realized that there's a name
that would be so much clearer

00:38:31.241 --> 00:38:33.677 line:92%
Now, the next continuity feature

00:38:33.677 --> 00:38:38.815
in macOS Sierra is
universal clipboard.

00:38:38.815 --> 00:38:41.952 line:92%
Now-- Wow, gasp.

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:47.457
So-- but I know copy and paste
is so fundamental to the way

00:38:47.457 --> 00:38:50.961
that we use our Macs
for so many years now.

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:53.597
But what if when you
are on even your iPhone

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:56.666
and you found some new text,
and you just want to copy it,

00:38:56.666 --> 00:38:59.169
that when you then
went to your Mac,

00:38:59.169 --> 00:39:02.305
well you could just
paste it right in.

00:39:02.305 --> 00:39:05.175
And now you can with
images, video,

00:39:05.175 --> 00:39:08.245 line:92%
everything completely automatic.

00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:12.716
Now I'd like to move
on to iCloud

00:39:12.716 --> 00:39:15.085 line:92%
and specifically iCloud Drive.

00:39:15.085 --> 00:39:18.522
Now today with iCloud
Drive, you can put documents

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.624
into your iCloud Drive
that you explicitly want

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:23.393
to make available to you
across your other systems

00:39:23.393 --> 00:39:25.495 line:92%
as well as your iOS devices.

00:39:25.495 --> 00:39:27.297
And customers have been
quite a bit of this.

00:39:27.297 --> 00:39:30.300
There are actually 10
billion customer documents

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.535 line:92%
in iCloud drive today.

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:34.237
But we want to take
this a step further.

00:39:34.237 --> 00:39:36.473 line:92%
We want all of your documents

00:39:36.473 --> 00:39:39.376
and your desktop
accessible to you everywhere.

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.711
So that when you're on one Mac,
maybe you're putting things

00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:43.413
in your normal documents
folder, well,

00:39:43.413 --> 00:39:44.714
of course those should
be available

00:39:44.714 --> 00:39:46.516 line:92%
to you on your other Macs.

00:39:46.516 --> 00:39:49.753
But you know for 30 years now,
we all learn to do the work,

00:39:49.753 --> 00:39:51.455
the things that we're
working on right now, well,

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:52.889 line:92%
where do we put those?

00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:55.058 line:92%
So often it's on our desktop.

00:39:55.058 --> 00:39:58.128
So let's make our desktop
available on our other Macs

00:39:58.128 --> 00:40:01.565
as well and have those
files be available to us

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:03.834 line:92%
on the go on our iPhones.

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.502 line:92%
Now you can.

Next up, optimized storage.

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.445 line:92%
You know, we love using our Macs

00:40:15.445 --> 00:40:16.947
and we fill them
with so much stuff.

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:19.082
But you're going to end up
with a situation like this.

00:40:19.082 --> 00:40:22.385
And, we know, what
do you do about it?

00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:24.621
Well, it turns out we're
going to give you a solution.

00:40:24.621 --> 00:40:26.556 line:92%
And it works in two ways.

00:40:26.556 --> 00:40:30.160
First, it helps you make
room for the files that--

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.830
your new files by keeping your
older ones up in the Cloud.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.433
So, whether it's your
full resolution photos,

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:38.735
when your others are in
iCloud Drive or movies

00:40:38.735 --> 00:40:41.171
that you've already
watched in iTunes

00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:44.474
or even those old mail
attachments, we can clear off

00:40:44.474 --> 00:40:46.443
that space locally and
make those things available

00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:47.644 line:92%
to you on demand.

00:40:47.644 --> 00:40:49.846
But we also want to make
it easy for you to get rid

00:40:49.846 --> 00:40:52.949
of files you'll never
use again automatically.

00:40:52.949 --> 00:40:56.052
Things like your Safari web
cache and maybe the trash

00:40:56.052 --> 00:40:57.554
that you keep forgetting
to empty

00:40:57.554 --> 00:41:00.056
and redundant data that's stored
by mail, well, we can get rid

00:41:00.056 --> 00:41:01.658 line:92%
of all of that as well.

00:41:01.658 --> 00:41:04.294
And we provide a really
simple user interface

00:41:04.294 --> 00:41:05.929 line:92%
to help you do it.

00:41:05.929 --> 00:41:09.199
Now, as a task, we took a
system that was nearly full,

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:11.468
had about let's say
20 gigs free,

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:13.236 line:92%
and we put it through the paces.

00:41:13.236 --> 00:41:16.706
Now, it had a lot of photos
and a lot of documents.

00:41:16.706 --> 00:41:19.342
It had movies that were
already watched, mail with lots

00:41:19.342 --> 00:41:22.245
of attachment, apps,
system files and so forth.

00:41:22.245 --> 00:41:24.848
And we turned on all the
switches for optimized storage.

00:41:24.848 --> 00:41:29.686
And we went from 20 gigs
free to 150 gigs free.

00:41:29.686 --> 00:41:30.654 line:92%
So, we think that's going

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:32.522

for all of you.

So, we all love using Apple Pay
in stores to pay with our phones

00:41:45.235 --> 00:41:48.071
and our Apple Watch
at the cash register

00:41:48.071 --> 00:41:51.675
and to shop inside apps
on our iOS devices.

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:52.642 line:92%
So, of course, we wanted

00:41:52.642 --> 00:41:55.679
to bring this experience
to the Mac.

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:59.115
We thought long and hard about
exactly the right way to do it.

00:41:59.115 --> 00:42:01.384 line:92%
And I think we'd nailed it.

for some carrying straps,
can be very helpful.

00:42:13.129 --> 00:42:15.198
No, this is not how people
are going to shop on our Macs.

00:42:15.198 --> 00:42:17.801
We shop online, on
the web, in Safari.

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:19.803 line:92%
And so, what are we doing?

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:22.505

with Apple Pay button
available to you.

When you click it, a sheet comes
down that actually prompts you

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:41.224
to securely authenticate your

just a tap on your wrist.

merchants are signed

up to bring their
web storefronts

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.245 line:92%
to support Apple Pay on the web.

00:43:02.245 --> 00:43:05.548
And Apple Pay is expanding
hugely geographically.

it's coming to Switzerland,

Now, next, I want
to move to part

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:22.298
of the Mac experience,
and that's tabs.

00:43:22.298 --> 00:43:26.536
You know, many of us love using
tabs to take a mess of windows

00:43:26.536 --> 00:43:29.305
that we have in Safari and
get them neatly organized

00:43:29.305 --> 00:43:30.674 line:92%
in tab set.

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:33.309
Well, now, we want
to bring that to all

00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:34.844 line:92%
of your multi-windowed apps.

00:43:34.844 --> 00:43:37.447
So, maybe you have multiple
windows open in maps, well,

00:43:37.447 --> 00:43:39.449
you could organize
those in tabs.

00:43:39.449 --> 00:43:41.718
But because it's built into
the system, you could do

00:43:41.718 --> 00:43:43.720 line:92%
that for third apps as well.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.689
In fact, we've implemented
it in a way

00:43:45.689 --> 00:43:48.425
that the apps you already have
installed can support this

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:51.428
out of the box without
any modification,

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:53.530 line:92%

like being on a Mac?

can do so much more.

Things like sophisticated
queries for files

like show the files I worked
on last week about the offsite.

your file is so styling.

&gt;&gt; So, we have my
search results.

00:45:44.607 --> 00:45:46.409
But what's really
incredible is I can refine

00:45:46.409 --> 00:45:49.312
that sophisticated query
with a follow on like,

for right there.

useful result that I may want

to throughout the day as I work.

on this plus button

search the web for me.

for pictures of falconry.

falconry I found on the web.

00:47:08.057 --> 00:47:09.559
&gt;&gt; OK. That looks
like some good fun.

00:47:09.559 --> 00:47:13.296
So, I can actually take the
results right out of Siri

00:47:13.296 --> 00:47:15.365 line:92%
and drag them into my document.

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.467 line:92%
It's pretty epic.

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:25.642
But, you know, I'd like to
actually replace this map

00:47:25.642 --> 00:47:28.845
with one that I've been
working on here on my iPad.

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:31.781
So, my iPad is so great because
I can actually use my Apple

00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:33.549 line:92%
Pencil to do some drawings.

00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:35.351
So, let's say, I'm going to
take my Apple Pencil here

00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:37.420 line:92%
and I'm going to draw a path.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.188
Maybe we'll take
a hike like this,

00:47:39.188 --> 00:47:41.257
maybe out over here,
just like that.

00:47:41.257 --> 00:47:43.326
OK, that looks like
just the drawing I want.

00:47:43.326 --> 00:47:45.828
But of course, I'd like
to now get it on my Mac.

00:47:45.828 --> 00:47:47.430 line:92%
So, how do I do that?

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:49.432 line:92%
Well, why don't I just copy it--

00:47:49.432 --> 00:47:52.435
but I'm not just copying it to
my iPad because when I return

00:47:52.435 --> 00:47:56.839
to my Mac, I can paste it just
like I would anything else,

00:47:56.839 --> 00:48:01.444
actually wirelessly transfers it
automatically into my document.

So, now that I looked
at this trip,

00:48:09.252 --> 00:48:10.954
I realized that it's
a horrible idea.

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:15.024
So, I can actually use
Siri to message my friend.

00:48:15.024 --> 00:48:19.696
Tell Ken, maybe we
should just see a movie.

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:22.465

ready to send it.

00:48:24.834 --> 00:48:25.868
&gt;&gt; So, I can use
Siri, of course,

00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:27.270 line:92%
to do messaging at any time.

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:30.340
And it can also help
me find that movie.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.408
What new movies are
playing this Friday?

00:48:32.408 --> 00:48:37.013
&gt;&gt; I found eight movies
playing on Friday.

00:48:37.013 --> 00:48:37.847 line:92%
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:48:37.847 --> 00:48:38.848 line:92%
So, Siri has given some results.

00:48:38.848 --> 00:48:40.450
And "Finding Dory"
looks pretty good.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.085 line:92%
So, let's open that up.

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:45.021 line:92%
Now, I can go play the trailer.

00:48:45.021 --> 00:48:46.923
[Background music] But I
could also drop it right here

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.591 line:92%
into picture-in-picture.

00:48:48.591 --> 00:48:50.626
And you see in
picture-in-picture,

00:48:50.626 --> 00:48:54.097 line:92%
I can actually resize if I want.

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:57.867
I can reposition the PIP
window to any corner.

00:48:57.867 --> 00:49:01.237
And, of course, it works
great in full screen,

00:49:01.237 --> 00:49:03.773
right on top of my
other content.

00:49:03.773 --> 00:49:06.142
So, this movie looks
pretty good.

00:49:06.142 --> 00:49:09.245
So, I think I'll go
back into the browser.

00:49:09.245 --> 00:49:10.780
And let's actually
buy some tickets.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.217
So, I see there's a showing
here at 7:15, I'll select that.

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.151 line:92%
Select the amount.

00:49:15.151 --> 00:49:17.253 line:92%
Let's go with 10 of us.

And here you see, buy
with Apple Pay button.

00:49:20.056 --> 00:49:22.492
So, watch what happens
when I click buy Apple Pay,

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:25.028
I'm prompted to confirm
here on my iPhone.

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:28.765
I just used Touch ID
with my fingerprint.

00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:33.803
And I can securely authenticate
my transaction just like that.

00:49:33.803 --> 00:49:38.775
And that is a quick
look in macOS Sierra.

00:49:40.676 --> 00:49:44.781
So, Sierra, some great features
for continuity, the Cloud,

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:49.185
Apple Pay, user experience
and, of course, Siri.

release ever for our users.

Now, there are 10 big features
I want to talk about today.

00:50:47.977 --> 00:50:52.882
And let's start off with number
one, that's user experience.

00:50:52.882 --> 00:50:56.352
Now, in iOS 10, we've
redesigned the experience

00:50:56.352 --> 00:50:57.687 line:92%
of the lock screen.

00:50:57.687 --> 00:51:00.656
With rich notifications, they
give you quick interaction

00:51:00.656 --> 00:51:04.327
with apps through the
expanded use of 3D Touch.

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:05.895
But rather than just
talk about it,

00:51:05.895 --> 00:51:07.997
how about I just show
it to you right now?

00:51:07.997 --> 00:51:09.499 line:92%

of us have noticed now

that we have our iPhone 6ses

with the incredibly
fast Touch ID sensor is

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:23.613
that we can just blow
past our notifications

have a great solution.

It's called raise to wake.

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:35.057

what's on your lock screen

without ever touching a button.

notice is these beautiful

no longer causing us

to darken the-- your wallpapers.

So, you get to look at that.

00:51:57.947 --> 00:51:59.982
But what's more important is
they're really interactive

00:51:59.982 --> 00:52:01.250 line:92%
through 3D Touch.

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.853
So, for instance with this
calendar notification,

00:52:03.853 --> 00:52:05.755 line:92%
I can just 3D Touch on it.

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:08.824
And I can jump right in and
get all this rich detail

00:52:08.824 --> 00:52:10.426 line:92%
about this invitation.

00:52:10.426 --> 00:52:11.427 line:92%
I can see my calendar.

And I can accept right here.

00:52:14.163 --> 00:52:16.933
Now, this is especially
great with messages.

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:19.001 line:92%
Let's 3D Touch into that one.

00:52:19.001 --> 00:52:21.871
And here, you see, I see the
message that was sent to me.

I can respond right
here, the keyboard.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.610
But what's great is I can
stay in the conversation,

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.911 line:92%
right here on the lock screen.

00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:31.847
And even get rich responses
like images right inline.

00:52:31.847 --> 00:52:34.984
And this works really well
with third-party apps as well.

00:52:34.984 --> 00:52:37.553
So, for instance if I get
a notification from Uber,

00:52:37.553 --> 00:52:42.091
I can just press in and I get
this completely interactive

00:52:42.091 --> 00:52:48.130

you can get your

if you want to clear them,

you can just press in and
clear them all with a tap.

gives me great access
to all my controls.

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:19.562
But if I swipe over, you
see, we have a special area

for our music with
nice big controls

and beautiful album
art right there.

easier than ever to get

at your camera from
the lock screen.

over from the right,

and there's my camera.

to get more information.

see the rest of my day.

And I can even get more
information right here

from apps on my home screen.

like I have decent number

of unread e-mail messages.

ignoring this whole time,

even launching the app.

get a look at my rings.

00:54:35.738 --> 00:54:38.974
on My Today view, I can just
add that widget like that.

Next, number two, Siri,

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:26.088
huge part of the user
experience in iOS.

00:55:26.088 --> 00:55:30.526
Now, Siri services over
two billion requests a week

00:55:30.526 --> 00:55:31.727 line:92%
from customers.

00:55:31.727 --> 00:55:34.497
And there's so many things
that you can ask Siri.

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:39.602
But now in iOS 10, Siri is going
to be able to do so much more

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:43.506
because we're opening
up Siri to developers.

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:52.581 line:92%
[ Applause ]

00:55:53.916 --> 00:55:57.887
Now, you'll be able to ask
Siri, things like, send a WeChat

00:55:57.887 --> 00:56:00.589
to Nancy saying, I'll
be five minutes late.

00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:03.959
And Siri can summon up
the WeChat UI right inside

00:56:03.959 --> 00:56:06.028 line:92%
of the Siri environment.

00:56:06.028 --> 00:56:09.799
Now, of course, Siri, because
it understands the domains

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:12.134
of things like messaging,
it allows you to say things

00:56:12.134 --> 00:56:13.536 line:92%
in so many different ways.

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:16.172
I could've said, WeChat Nancy
that I'll be five minutes late

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:17.506 line:92%
or I need to send a message

00:56:17.506 --> 00:56:20.042
to Nancy via WeChat saying
I'll be five minutes late.

00:56:20.042 --> 00:56:22.645
And I could do that in all
sorts of different languages.

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:25.414
But because now in iOS 10,
we have an intense API,

00:56:25.414 --> 00:56:29.318
it allows Siri to take
on that part of the work

00:56:29.318 --> 00:56:32.955
and lets the extension do what
it does best, like messaging.

00:56:32.955 --> 00:56:36.559
And so, now, we support
messaging with apps like,

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:40.129
Slack and WhatsApp
and, of course, WeChat.

00:56:40.129 --> 00:56:43.132
It could do things like ride
booking in Siri with services

00:56:43.132 --> 00:56:48.671
like Uber, Lyft and Didi in
China, photo search for--

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:52.975
in apps like IM,
Shutterfly and Pinterest.

00:56:52.975 --> 00:56:57.480
And you could start, pause
and stop your workouts in apps

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.916
like MapMyRun, Runtastic
and Runkeeper.

00:57:00.916 --> 00:57:04.220
And even do payments to
send money to friends,

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:08.924
with things like Number 26,
Square Cash and Alipay in China.

00:57:08.924 --> 00:57:11.760 line:92%
And do VoIP calling through apps

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.697
like Cisco Spark,
Vonage and Skype.

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:17.032
And it works great
in the car as well.

00:57:17.032 --> 00:57:21.937
Because with CarPlay, you can
now safely send your messages

00:57:21.937 --> 00:57:26.075
as well as make VoIP calls all
inside the CarPlay environment

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:27.176 line:92%
with your favorite apps.

00:57:27.176 --> 00:57:31.480
And that's a quick
update on Siri.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:38.120 line:92%
[ Applause ]

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.689 line:92%
Number three, QuickType.

00:57:40.689 --> 00:57:44.627
And the big news this year is
we're bringing Siri intelligence

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.362 line:92%
to the keyboard.

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:50.599
So, today, QuickType is
able to use a context

00:57:50.599 --> 00:57:53.936
to help predict what
words you might type next.

00:57:53.936 --> 00:57:56.005
Well, now, we're
using deep learning

00:57:56.005 --> 00:57:58.641
and a technique specifically
called LSTMs

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:02.444
to enable much more
intelligence in longer context.

00:58:02.444 --> 00:58:04.747
So, we can tell the difference
between, the Orioles are playing

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:07.383
in the playoffs and the
children are playing

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:09.351 line:92%
in the park automatically.

00:58:09.351 --> 00:58:12.821
And Siri can help you do
responses more intelligently

00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:13.889 line:92%
than ever.

00:58:13.889 --> 00:58:15.991
So, you might get
asked, where are you?

00:58:15.991 --> 00:58:18.594
Well, Siri can suggest right
there on the suggestion bar

00:58:18.594 --> 00:58:20.896
that you supply your
current location.

00:58:20.896 --> 00:58:22.665
Tap it and you can
get your location

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:25.801
with the map right
into your transcript.

00:58:25.801 --> 00:58:28.237
And people might ask you
about contact information

00:58:28.237 --> 00:58:31.106
for a friend, well, Siri
can automatically offer

00:58:31.106 --> 00:58:34.276 line:92%
up the most relevant contacts.

00:58:34.276 --> 00:58:37.713
Now, right locally on your
device, Siri has information

00:58:37.713 --> 00:58:39.648 line:92%
about what you've been doing.

00:58:39.648 --> 00:58:42.318
And so, it can extract
information from a message

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:43.586
that maybe says,
oh, you're talking

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:46.055
about dim sum at
11 a.m. on Sunday?

00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:47.056 line:92%
Well, when you go

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:49.224
to automatically
create a calendar event,

00:58:49.224 --> 00:58:51.694
Siri can prefill it for
you with things like,

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.295 line:92%
oh, that must be brunch.

00:58:53.295 --> 00:58:54.630 line:92%
Fill out the location.

00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:55.831 line:92%
Pick the time.

00:58:55.831 --> 00:58:57.700 line:92%
It's really smart.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.002 line:92%
And Siri does so much more.

00:59:00.002 --> 00:59:01.904
It can check your
calendar availability

00:59:01.904 --> 00:59:03.238 line:92%
for you automatically.

00:59:03.238 --> 00:59:06.275
Help you paste a recent
address automatically.

00:59:06.275 --> 00:59:10.412
Fill it in based on addresses
you were browsing in other apps.

00:59:10.412 --> 00:59:12.581
It can help you look
up terms it recognizes,

00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:14.650
things like movies
and restaurants.

00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:16.852
With one tap, you can
get more information.

00:59:16.852 --> 00:59:20.089
And Siri now-- the
QuickType keyboard supports

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:22.091 line:92%
multilingual typing.

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.093
So, if you like typing
alternating maybe

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:27.162
between English and
Spanish or Italian,

00:59:27.162 --> 00:59:29.298
you don't have to
switch keyboards.

00:59:29.298 --> 00:59:31.467
QuickType can follow
you automatically.

[ Applause ]

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:35.504 line:92%
So, that's QuickType.

00:59:35.504 --> 00:59:39.074 line:92%
Next, number four is photos.

00:59:39.074 --> 00:59:42.678
Now, we love capturing
so much of our lives

00:59:42.678 --> 00:59:45.748
on our cameras with--
on our iPhones.

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:47.116 line:92%
They're so great.

00:59:47.116 --> 00:59:49.885
And with iCloud Photo Library,
we have those photos with us

00:59:49.885 --> 00:59:52.187 line:92%
across all of our devices.

00:59:52.187 --> 00:59:55.424
Well, we wanted to give you
easier ways, of course, to find

00:59:55.424 --> 00:59:57.626
and experience the
photos that you've taken.

00:59:57.626 --> 01:00:00.162 line:92%
And one of those is with places.

01:00:00.162 --> 01:00:03.565
So now, we let you see all
of your photos on a map.

01:00:03.565 --> 01:00:06.301
It's a great way to
relive a trip for instance.

01:00:06.301 --> 01:00:09.538
But the big news in photos
this year is advanced

01:00:09.538 --> 01:00:10.873 line:92%
computer vision.

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:13.442
We're applying advanced
deep learning techniques

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:17.246
to bring facial recognition
to the iPhone

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.249
and it's all done locally
on device taking advantage

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.451
of the power of the
advanced silicon

01:00:22.451 --> 01:00:24.420 line:92%
in all of our iOS devices.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.756
You can get all of your most
important people automatically

01:00:27.756 --> 01:00:32.628
built in the people albums for
you automatically and all done

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:34.296 line:92%
with your privacy protected.

01:00:34.296 --> 01:00:36.598
Now, we're applying the
same kind of technology

01:00:36.598 --> 01:00:40.903
with deep learning to object
and scene recognition as well.

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:45.374
In fact, we do 11 billion
computations per photo

01:00:45.374 --> 01:00:47.676
to be able to detect
things like there's a horse,

01:00:47.676 --> 01:00:49.378
there's water, there's
a mountain.

01:00:49.378 --> 01:00:52.715
And with this, you can do
really powerful searching

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:55.150 line:92%
on your device.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.786
But, you know, sometimes,
the magic in experiencing

01:00:57.786 --> 01:01:00.289
in your photos isn't just
about finding the photo

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.790
that you know you're
looking for,

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:04.760
it's about being reminded
serendipitously of a memory

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.028 line:92%
that would be so special.

01:01:06.028 --> 01:01:09.498
And so now, we're using
advanced artificial intelligence

01:01:09.498 --> 01:01:13.435
to analyze across your entire
photo library, all done locally

01:01:13.435 --> 01:01:17.439
on device, to cluster together
photos and relate them based

01:01:17.439 --> 01:01:21.110
on location, the people
involved, the scenes.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.778
And out of this, be
able to surface memories

01:01:22.778 --> 01:01:25.614
that would be most relevant
to you at any given moment.

01:01:25.614 --> 01:01:28.383
We can bring forward
things like trips.

01:01:28.383 --> 01:01:31.019
We can spot trips that
might be important to you.

01:01:31.019 --> 01:01:33.522
We can figure out that you
might want to see photos

01:01:33.522 --> 01:01:36.692
of a highlight reel of the
last weekend or the last year

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:39.461
and offer those to you
at just the right time.

01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:42.965
We can bring forward memories
of people that are special

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.067 line:92%
to you or groups of people.

01:01:45.067 --> 01:01:48.403
And topics, special photos
you took, for instance,

01:01:48.403 --> 01:01:51.073
when you're on the water, at
the beach, at the mountains,

01:01:51.073 --> 01:01:54.510
these can make wonderful
memories to survey over time.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:57.412
But most important,
we pull these together

01:01:57.412 --> 01:02:02.484
into an intuitive user interface
that makes these so engaging.

01:02:02.484 --> 01:02:06.488

you that experience now.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.996 line:92%
So let's take a look at photos.

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:17.299
So we see there's a photo
album here of a family.

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:18.433 line:92%
But what you'll notice

01:02:18.433 --> 01:02:21.069
at the bottom is this
new tab called Memories.

01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:22.271 line:92%
Let's take a look.

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.907
So we can see here, there
are number of memories

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.442
that have been offered up
into this memory speed.

01:02:27.442 --> 01:02:28.944
And at the top, there's
a vacation

01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:30.078 line:92%
that the system has spotted

01:02:30.078 --> 01:02:32.648
where the family took
a trip to Tahoe City.

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:35.551
Let's dive in and take
a look at a memory.

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:38.020
Now you see there's actually
a movie up at the top,

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.288
we'll talk more about
that later.

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:42.157
And down below, there's
this beautiful layout

01:02:42.157 --> 01:02:43.759 line:92%
of highlights of the photos.

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:46.929
Now, I can tap Show All
and actually see a grid

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.330 line:92%
of every photo that was taken.

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:50.866
But you can see how the
summary intelligently draws

01:02:50.866 --> 01:02:54.069
out the most special
photos into these highlights

01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:55.537 line:92%
that are really great to browse.

01:02:55.537 --> 01:02:58.841
Now, if we go further down, we
see that it's actually pulled

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:02.311
up a set of people that are in
the photo, the family, grandma

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.712 line:92%
and grandpa and the uncle.

01:03:03.712 --> 01:03:07.216
And a map of the location where
all of those photos were taken.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:09.117 line:92%
And down here at the bottom,

01:03:09.117 --> 01:03:11.220
we have related other
memories I might want

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.221 line:92%
to see related to this one.

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.589 line:92%
And it's really smart.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:18.193
So you see that the Santa Cruz
and Fourth of July memories,

01:03:18.193 --> 01:03:20.162
where grandma and grandpa
were both on the trip

01:03:20.162 --> 01:03:21.363 line:92%
into Tahoe City and in these.

01:03:21.363 --> 01:03:23.065
So those are offered
up as related.

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:25.067
And this Tahoe City trip
was an outdoor vacation,

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.369
so it would offered up
another one like Alaska.

01:03:27.369 --> 01:03:30.105
And you can see, there's
another time the family was also

01:03:30.105 --> 01:03:32.107
at Tahoe City, but this
time in the winter.

01:03:32.107 --> 01:03:34.710
And I'm going to jump in
to that related memory.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:38.380
And you see once again, we have
photos and videos at the bottom.

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.817
But I want to highlight the
movie up here at the top.

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:44.820
You know, we all take so
many pictures and movies

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.055
and we never go back to
actually assemble them

01:03:47.055 --> 01:03:49.091
into something we'd
want to watch.

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:52.327
But, now our iPhone can do
that for us automatically.

01:04:36.605 --> 01:04:39.875
of the Photos App is now doing
analysis of just the right parts

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:42.377
of the video to include
the right photos

01:04:42.377 --> 01:04:45.047

together with the right mood

Now, when you have
a memory like this,

01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:50.018 line:92%
you often want to share it.

01:04:50.018 --> 01:04:51.687
And sometimes, you might want
to make it a little shorter say

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:54.556
for sharing, so I can just
use this slider at the bottom

01:04:54.556 --> 01:04:56.525
and say, I'd like
it to be shorter.

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:58.393
And maybe I want to change
the mood a little it.

01:04:58.393 --> 01:05:00.595
You notice there's a mood
slider just up above there

01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:02.331
and that was a pretty
great snowball fight.

Can't wait to do it.

01:06:24.479 --> 01:06:26.715
So, let's talk-- Let's
get started with Maps.

01:06:26.715 --> 01:06:29.017
Now last year, we
introduced Nearby,

01:06:29.017 --> 01:06:31.686
a great way to find
places and transit

01:06:31.686 --> 01:06:33.288 line:92%
with an incredible amount

01:06:33.288 --> 01:06:35.057
of detail including
all the entrances

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:37.359 line:92%
and exits from every station.

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:41.196
But for iOS 10, we've got
an all new design for Maps.

01:06:41.196 --> 01:06:43.598
It starts with making it
easy to access controls

01:06:43.598 --> 01:06:45.834 line:92%
and details on locations.

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:48.670
And we're making Maps do
more for you in advance.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:50.372 line:92%
It's more proactive.

01:06:50.372 --> 01:06:53.875
So you slide up from the
bottom and you can suggestions.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:57.846
Maps knows that usually, at
this time, I usually go to work,

01:06:57.846 --> 01:07:02.184
or it can look at a calendar
event and find the location.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.786
It also gives you
convenient ways to filter

01:07:04.786 --> 01:07:07.055
down in the places
you might want to go.

01:07:07.055 --> 01:07:09.157
For example, let's take a
look at restaurants nearby.

01:07:09.157 --> 01:07:12.594
But we're in San Francisco,
I feel like seafood.

01:07:12.594 --> 01:07:15.464
So I can slide across
the bottom, and now,

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:17.199
I can see all the
seafood restaurants right

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.468 line:92%

even include traffic on route.

will automatically zoom in

along straight away,

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.290
it willl automatically
zoom back out.

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:45.827

zoom way further ahead

So now, you can even look and
see on your route where food

01:07:59.407 --> 01:08:02.644

will tell you how much longer it

01:08:02.644 --> 01:08:05.447
will take if you go
to any one of those.

Now, on to number

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:03.237
You know, before we announce
HomeKit two years ago,

01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:06.808
the home accessory space
was a mess of incompatible

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:10.411
and insecure protocols and
accessories that required you

01:19:10.411 --> 01:19:13.447
to download a separate app
that you needed to learn just

01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:16.250
to control each individual
accessory.

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:19.453
But with HomeKit, we've
been changing all that.

01:19:19.453 --> 01:19:22.290
We're making sure that your
home automation products work

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.459 line:92%
together easily and securely.

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:27.662
And this year, we've
rounded out the set

of accessory types
supported by HomeKit

01:19:29.864 --> 01:19:32.266

getting on board as well.

If you want to turn on the
light, of course, just tap it.

If you want to adjust the
dimmer, we'll just press

01:20:34.028 --> 01:20:35.930 line:92%
in a little harder and slide

01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:38.432
and you can adjust the
dimmer just like that.

01:20:38.432 --> 01:20:41.135
So you can tap, tap, tap
across all the accessories

01:20:41.135 --> 01:20:42.870 line:92%
in your home, but sometimes,

01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:44.939
you'd like to trigger a
change to all of them.

01:20:44.939 --> 01:20:47.108
And for that, we have
something we call Scenes.

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:49.977
So for instance, if you
want to get ready for bed,

01:20:49.977 --> 01:20:52.947 line:92%
you can tap Good Night.

01:20:52.947 --> 01:20:54.949
You'll see they'll close

lock the front door, adjust the
thermostat, all in one step.

Now Siri knows how to
interact with Scenes as well.

So in the morning, you
say good morning to Siri.

Well Siri can automatically
get your home all ready for you

in your home, it can serve

01:21:55.676 --> 01:21:57.745

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:02.850
So when you're on the go,
you can actually access all

of your accessories,
securely end to end encrypted

01:22:05.753 --> 01:22:09.223
and you can setup automation
like Geofences so that

01:22:09.223 --> 01:22:11.592
when you roll into your
driveway, you can make sure

01:22:11.592 --> 01:22:14.428
that the garage door will
open, the lights will turn on

01:22:14.428 --> 01:22:16.397
and maybe even the hot tub
will start up in the back

Now, the Home app is
great on the iPhone.

01:22:24.338 --> 01:22:26.540
It's also fantastic
on the iPad as well.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.908
So many people like
using the iPad

01:22:27.908 --> 01:22:30.644
as the ultimate home control
device whether they're mounted

01:22:30.644 --> 01:22:32.613
on the wall or on
the coffee table.

01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:35.783
And of course, there's
nothing beating the remote

You know, we all
receive a lot of calls,

01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:58.773
but we want to make sure that
when you miss their calls,

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.975
you have the best
experience possible.

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:05.246

get voice mail transcription

like this and we wonder
what the heck it's about.

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:19.960
And unfortunately, in China,
this can be a real problem

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.530
where there's a lot
of voice mail spam.

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:24.965
So now, we're supporting
an extension API

01:23:24.965 --> 01:23:28.636
where third parties like
Tencent can provide information

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:31.839
automatically to tell you
a possible phone spam.

01:23:31.839 --> 01:23:33.574

when you receive a call,

01:23:50.758 --> 01:23:54.295
Well now in iOS 10, we
have a great new VoIP API,

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.763 line:92%
that means you're experience

They're in your phone Favorites.

01:24:12.179 --> 01:24:14.648
And your contact card
has been enhanced,

01:24:14.648 --> 01:24:17.017
so it remembers how you
like to call each person

01:24:17.017 --> 01:24:21.088
and you can access them
that way with just a tap.

01:24:21.088 --> 01:24:24.291
So we've been working
with our partner Cisco

01:24:24.291 --> 01:24:27.862
on elevating mobility
in the enterprise.

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.831
And now using our
VoiP API combined

01:24:30.831 --> 01:24:34.101
with their Cisco Spark
app, it's never been easier

01:24:34.101 --> 01:24:36.704
to use your iPhone with
work because in addition

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:40.508
to receiving calls made to
your personal cell number,

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:43.377
you also can receive calls
made to your work number right

at your desk or on the go.

So next, number 10 and this
one is a doozy, it's Messages.

01:25:01.562 --> 01:25:05.266
Now Messages is the most
frequently used app on iOS

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:07.134 line:92%
and people love sharing things

01:25:07.134 --> 01:25:09.670
with Messages whether
it's photos or links

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.306
to their favorite websites,
but they look like this

01:25:12.306 --> 01:25:15.242
but not any longer because
now we have rich links.

01:25:15.242 --> 01:25:18.913
So when you share links, you
get artwork from the website,

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:21.215
extracted titles,
it's really great.

01:25:21.215 --> 01:25:23.784
And it's especially awesome when
you get to share with things

01:25:23.784 --> 01:25:25.619
like video because
they can play right

01:25:25.619 --> 01:25:29.490 line:92%

better than ever in Messages.

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.135
Now when you bring
up the camera,

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:43.404
you immediately see what's
right in front of your camera.

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:45.272
Like someone in marketing
thought, that's what someone

01:25:45.272 --> 01:25:47.308

them right into your transcript.

But you know, we wanted to
do something more fundamental

01:27:04.785 --> 01:27:08.922
with messaging because today
no matter what you say,

01:27:08.922 --> 01:27:10.524 line:92%
it's always the same bubble.

01:27:10.524 --> 01:27:15.396
It always-- this comes across
the same way, but no longer

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:18.098
because now we have
Bubble effects.

01:27:18.098 --> 01:27:22.736
So if you want to say it
loud, you can say it loud.

01:27:22.736 --> 01:27:25.105
And if you want to
say it more gently,

01:27:25.105 --> 01:27:29.243
well now you can
do that as well.

01:27:30.744 --> 01:27:33.280

you want to get

across something personal.

01:27:35.082 --> 01:27:38.152
An Invisible ink gives
you the way to do that.

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:40.254
So you can just slide your
finger across the bubble

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:44.825
and clear away the message like
that and it's a really great way

01:27:44.825 --> 01:27:47.294
to share a surprise,
a little scared

to tack on the end.

words throughout my message

is tap to replace them.

to let her know how I feel
about it, using tap X,

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:57.684

as double tapping

that fun and honestly,

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:46.753
and we can just add that to
our, to our cart like this

01:38:46.753 --> 01:38:51.558
and then drop it,
write in the messages.

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:55.495
And it's fortunate Brian
will be paying for this.

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:01.134
So, a final thing
I'd like to show you

01:39:01.134 --> 01:39:05.805
with iMessage apps are these
really fun interactive kinds

01:39:05.805 --> 01:39:06.573 line:92%
of apps.

01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:08.241 line:92%
And one example is JibJab.

01:39:08.241 --> 01:39:10.643
So let's jump right
into JibJab here.

01:39:10.643 --> 01:39:12.812
We see there are a whole
bunch of fun things.

01:39:12.812 --> 01:39:15.281
You can scroll through and
see the options I can also

01:39:15.281 --> 01:39:18.385
of course select from
a gallery of faces.

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:22.622
Let's pick Eddy maybe and,
you know, I can just drop him

01:39:22.622 --> 01:39:26.993
in to the transcript
just like that.

01:39:26.993 --> 01:39:29.095
And I think this gives
you the sense of the power

01:39:29.095 --> 01:39:32.465 line:92%
of iMessage apps and iOS 10.

01:39:39.906 --> 01:39:41.741 line:92%
So this is the new Messages.

01:39:41.741 --> 01:39:43.643
It's of course fantastic
on your iPhone.

01:39:43.643 --> 01:39:46.980
All of this is available to
you on your iPad as well.

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.916
And your Mac and your
Apple Watch can receive all

01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:52.719
of these interactive
content as well.

01:39:52.719 --> 01:39:57.424
So that's Messages, part of
10 huge features in iOS 10.

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:59.926
But of course there is so
much more that we can't have--

01:39:59.926 --> 01:40:02.262
talk about right now
but I can't help myself

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:05.765
but mention just a couple more
things like Notes collaboration.

01:40:05.765 --> 01:40:06.966 line:92%
You now can work live

01:40:06.966 --> 01:40:09.669
with multiple people
in the same note.

01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:13.206
Conversation view in mails,
so you can scroll from message

01:40:13.206 --> 01:40:16.843
to message in a single thread
on your iPhone and iPad.

01:40:16.843 --> 01:40:18.278
Live photos are better
than ever.

They have-- We have digital
video image stabilization.

01:40:21.381 --> 01:40:25.351
So they're buttery smooth and
they're editable now as well.

01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:29.022
And finally, split
view in Safari on iPad.

01:40:29.022 --> 01:40:34.527
So you can fit two websites side
by side in Safari on your iPad.

Now, iOS 10 is a fantastic
release for our users.

01:40:42.368 --> 01:40:45.271
It's also a gigantic
release for our developers.

01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:46.539 line:92%
When you think about it,

01:40:46.539 --> 01:40:49.476
experiences like the lock
screen with notifications.

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:55.315
The phone, maps, messages,
every major area of iOS now open

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:58.551
to developers and so
many other options.

01:40:58.551 --> 01:41:01.121
But, you know, all
of this great work

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:04.557
in iOS 10 would be
meaningless to us if it came

01:41:04.557 --> 01:41:07.927 line:92%
at the expense of your privacy.

01:41:07.927 --> 01:41:13.032
And so, in every feature that
we do, we carefully consider how

01:41:13.032 --> 01:41:14.901 line:92%
to protect your privacy.

01:41:14.901 --> 01:41:18.304
With apps like FaceTime
and Messages and HomeKit,

01:41:18.304 --> 01:41:23.276
we make sure to use end to end
encryption by default and always

01:41:23.276 --> 01:41:24.611 line:92%
to protect your communication.

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:29.149
And when it comes to performing
advanced deep learning

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:32.619
and artificial intelligence
analysis of your data,

01:41:32.619 --> 01:41:35.188
we're doing it on device
using the incredible power

01:41:35.188 --> 01:41:38.057
of the silicon on your
iPhone and your Mac,

01:41:38.057 --> 01:41:41.594
keeping your personal
data under your control.

01:41:41.594 --> 01:41:44.631
And when you do do searches on
the internet maybe for a route

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:48.701
and maps or a search for
information in Spotlight,

01:41:48.701 --> 01:41:51.838
we don't build any
user profiles.

01:41:51.838 --> 01:41:54.674
Now, of course one of
the important tools

01:41:54.674 --> 01:41:58.178
in making software more
intelligent is to spot patterns

01:41:58.178 --> 01:42:01.047
on how multiple users
are using their devices.

01:42:01.047 --> 01:42:03.716
For instance, you might want to
know what new words are trending

01:42:03.716 --> 01:42:08.521
so you could offer them up more
readily in a QuickType keyboard.

01:42:08.521 --> 01:42:12.158
Well, differential privacy is
a research topic in the area

01:42:12.158 --> 01:42:16.996
of statistics and data analytics
that uses hashing, subsampling

01:42:16.996 --> 01:42:19.098
and noise injection
to enable this kind

01:42:19.098 --> 01:42:22.602
of crowd-sourced learning
while keeping the information

01:42:22.602 --> 01:42:25.104
of each individual user
completely private.

01:42:25.104 --> 01:42:28.041
Now, Apple has been doing
some super important work

01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:31.878
in this area to enable
differential privacy

01:42:31.878 --> 01:42:36.249
to be deployed at a scale and
we brought in the professor

01:42:36.249 --> 01:42:38.851

literally co-wrote the book

01:42:38.851 --> 01:42:42.422
on differential privacy for a
quick peek at what we were doing

Now, as we said earlier,
an important part

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:28.588
of making this platform so
capable is our developers.

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:32.425
We believe it's crucial that
we provide the best tools

so you can create the best apps.

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:37.397 line:92%
That's why we created Swift.

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:40.600
Swift is a powerful and
intuitive programming language

watchOS, and tvOS.

01:45:45.471 --> 01:45:50.276
And writing Swift code is fun
and interactive and apps written

01:45:50.276 --> 01:45:53.546 line:92%
in it are lighting fast.

01:45:53.546 --> 01:45:57.784
Since we released Swift
less than two years ago,

01:45:57.784 --> 01:46:01.587
we've seen an amazing response
from the developer community.

01:46:01.587 --> 01:46:04.157
There's already more
than 100,000 apps

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:08.661

Swift code including great apps

01:46:08.661 --> 01:46:12.231
like Twitter and
Strava and Lyft.

01:46:12.231 --> 01:46:16.536
Now, we wanted everyone to
use Swift so we released it

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:19.138
as open source in
December and since then,

01:46:19.138 --> 01:46:21.741 line:92%
the adoption has been amazing.

It's already the number one
language project on GitHub.

Swift is powerful but it's also
simple and it's approachable.

So it can be your very
first programming language.

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:39.525
This is a very important
point for us.

01:46:39.525 --> 01:46:44.564
Because Swift is so easy to
learn, it has the potential

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:47.767
to bring many more
people into coding.

like to take even further.

The solution here, and I
know you've all got this,

01:50:32.858 --> 01:50:35.995
is that I need to repeat
that block of code four times

01:50:35.995 --> 01:50:39.098
to get Byte around all
four sides of the world.

01:50:39.098 --> 01:50:41.801
To do that, I'm going
to need a for loop.

I'll tap the plus up top to open
my code library and all I have

01:50:46.105 --> 01:50:51.310
to do is just drag a for
loop right into my code.

all around my code.

OK. Keep your eyes on
Byte as I run my code.

He moves forward, gets the gem,
makes a turn, and this time

01:51:17.803 --> 01:51:20.840
with the added for loop,
he just keeps ongoing.

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:43.709
&gt;&gt; It's really incredible
to see the inspirations

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:45.744 line:92%
of so many amazing developers.

01:59:45.744 --> 01:59:49.181
I can't wait to see what
this next generation

01:59:49.181 --> 01:59:50.349
of developers are
going to create

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:51.783
to make the world
a better place.

01:59:51.783 --> 01:59:56.255
So I told you it was
going to be jam packed.

01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:59.891 line:92%
What a great morning.

01:59:59.891 --> 02:00:03.795
Great updates from --
to all of the platforms,

02:00:03.795 --> 02:00:09.101
starting with watchOS, faster
performance, better navigation,

02:00:09.101 --> 02:00:10.969
all new fitness and
health features

02:00:10.969 --> 02:00:13.538 line:92%
to help you live a better life.

02:00:13.538 --> 02:00:17.743 line:92%
tvOS, the future of TV is apps,

02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:19.278
and now it just got
a whole lot better

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:22.881
with expanded series
search and single sign on.

02:00:22.881 --> 02:00:28.887
macOS Sierra, bringing Siri
and Apple Pay to the Mac along

02:00:28.887 --> 02:00:32.457
with some other incredibly
powerful features.

02:00:32.457 --> 02:00:37.929
And a gigantic release of iOS,
the mother of all releases,

02:00:37.929 --> 02:00:41.366
incredible new features for
Messages, all new designs

02:00:41.366 --> 02:00:44.269
for Photos, Apple
News and Apple Music,

02:00:44.269 --> 02:00:48.206
and incredible new
opportunities for developers

02:00:48.206 --> 02:00:53.345
to integrate their apps with
Siri, Maps and Messages.

02:00:53.345 --> 02:01:02.220
At Apple, we believe that
technology should lift humanity,

02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:05.257
should enrich people's lives
in all the ways they want

02:01:05.257 --> 02:01:10.829
to experience it, whether
it's on their wrist,

02:01:10.829 --> 02:01:17.869
in their living room, on their
desk, in the palm of their hand,

02:01:17.869 --> 02:01:23.241
in the car, or even
automating their home,

02:01:23.241 --> 02:01:30.248
this is a huge moment for
us, four great platforms

02:01:30.248 --> 02:01:36.421
that become even more capable
with working with all of you.

02:01:36.421 --> 02:01:39.224
I'd like to thank all of the
developers here today and all

02:01:39.224 --> 02:01:43.562
of those watching us that have
partnered with us in our quest

02:01:43.562 --> 02:01:46.365
to change the world
for the better.

02:01:46.365 --> 02:01:52.137
And of course, I'd like to thank
everyone at Apple, all the teams

02:01:52.137 --> 02:01:56.141
that worked so hard to
make this day happen.

02:01:56.141 --> 02:01:59.544
Thank you very much and
have a fantastic week.
